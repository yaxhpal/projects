<p><strong>Directions for the following 7 (seven) items:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Read the following two passages and answer the items that follow each passage. Your answers to these items should be based on the passages only.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passage -1</strong></p>
<p>The law in many parts of the world increasingly restricts the discharge of agricultural slurry into watercourses. The simplest and often the most economically sound practice returns the material to the land as semisolid manure or as sprayed slurry. This dilutes its concentration in the environment to what might have occurred III a more primitive and sustainable type of agriculture and converts pollutant into fertilizer. Soil microorganisms decompose the organic components of sewage and slurry and most of the mineral nutrients become available to be absorbed again by the vegetation.</p>
<p>The excess input of nutrients, both nitrogen and phosphorus - based, from agricultural runoff (and human sewage) has caused many 'healthy' oligotrophic lakes (low nutrient concentrations, low plant productivity with abundant water weeds, and clear water) to change to eutrophic condition where high nutrient inputs lead to high phytoplankton productivity (sometimes dominated by bloom-forming toxic species). This makes the water turbid, eliminates large plants and, in the worst situations, leads to anoxia and fish kills; so called cultural eutrophication. Thus, important ecosystem services arc lost, including the provisioning service of wild-caught fish and the cultural services associated with recreation.</p>
<p>The process of cultural eutrophication of lakes has been understood for some time. But only recently did scientists notice huge 'dead zones' in the oceans near river outlets, particularly those draining large catchment areas such as the Mississippi in North America and the Yangtze in China. The nutrient-enriched water flows through streams, rivers and lakes, and eventually to the estuary and ocean where the ecological impact may be huge, killing virtually all invertebrates and fish in areas up to 70,000 km2 in extent. More than 150 sea areas worldwide are now regularly starved of oxygen as a result of decomposition of algal blooms, fuelled particularly by nitrogen from agricultural runoff of fertilizers and sewage from large cities. Oceanic dead zones are typically associated with industrialized nations and usually lie off'- 'countries that subsidize their agriculture, encouraging farmers to increase productivity and use more fertilizer.</p>
<p><strong>10. According to the passage, why should the discharge of agricultural slurry into watercourses be restricted?</strong>@#$%$#1. Losing nutrients in this way is not a good practice economically. @#$%$#2. Watercourses do not contain the microorganisms that can decompose organic components of agricultural slurry. @#$%$#3. The discharge may lead to the eutrophication of water bodies. @#$%$#Select the correct answer using the codes given below @#$%$#(a) 1 only @#$%$#(b) 2 and 3 only @#$%$#(c) 1 and 3 only @#$%$#(d) 1, 2 and 3</p>
<p><strong>11. The passage refers to the conversion of "pollutant to fertilizer". What is pollutant and what is fertilizer in this context? </strong>@#$%$#(a) Decomposed organic component of slurry is pollutant and microorganisms in soil constitute fertilizer. @#$%$#(b) Discharged agricultural slurry is pollutant and decomposed slurry in soil is fertilizer.@#$%$#(c) Sprayed slurry is pollutant and watercourse is fertilizer.@#$%$#(d) None of the above expressions is correct in this context.</p>
<p><strong>12. According to the passage, what are the effects of indiscriminate use of fertilizers?</strong>@#$%$#1. Addition of pollutants to the soil and water. @#$%$#2. Destruction decomposer of microorganisms in soil.@#$%$#3. Nutrient enrichment of water bodies. @#$%$#4. Creation of algal blooms. @#$%$#Select the correct answer from the codes given below:@#$%$#(a) 1, 2 and 3 only @#$%$#(b) 1, 3 and 4 only@#$%$#(c) 2 arid 4 only @#$%$#(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4</p>
<p><strong>13. What is/are the characteristics of a water body with cultural eutrophication? </strong>@#$%$#1. Loss of ecosystem services @#$%$#2. Loss of flora and fauna @#$%$#3. Loss of mineral nutrients @#$%$#Select the correct answer using the code given below @#$%$#(a) 1 only @#$%$#(b) 1 and 2 only @#$%$#(c) 2 and 3 only @#$%$#(d) 1, 2 and 3</p>
<p><strong>14. What is the central theme of this passage? </strong>@#$%$#(a) Appropriate legislation is essential to protect the environment.@#$%$#(b) Modern agriculture is responsible for the destruction of environment. @#$%$#(c) Improper waste disposal from agriculture can destroy the aquatic ecosystems. @#$%$#(d) Use of chemical fertilizers is undesirable in agriculture.</p>
<p><strong>Passage - 2 </strong></p>
<p>The miseries of the world cannot be cured by physical help only. Until man's nature changes, his physical needs will always arise, and miseries will always be felt, and no amount of physical help will remove them completely. The only solution of the problem is to make mankind pure. Ignorance is the mother of evil and of all the misery we sec. Let men have light, let them be pure and spiritually strong and educated; then alone will misery cease in the world. We may convert every house in the country into a charitable asylum, we may fill the land with hospitals, but human misery will continue until man's character changes.</p>
<p><strong>15. According to the passage, which of the following statements is most likely to be true as the reason for man's miseries?</strong>@#$%$#(a) The poor economic and social conditions prevailing in society.@#$%$#(b) The refusal on the part of man to change his character. @#$%$#(c) The absence of physical and material help from his society. @#$%$#(d) Ever increasing physical' needs due to changing social structure.</p>
<p><strong>16. With reference to the passage, the following assumptions have been made:</strong>@#$%$#1. The author gives primary importance to physical and material help in eradicating human misery. @#$%$#2. Charitable homes, hospitals, etc. can remove human misery to a great extent.@#$%$#Which of the assumptions is/are valid?@#$%$#(a) 1 only @#$%$#(b) 2 only @#$%$#(c) Both 1 and 2 @#$%$#(d) Neither 1 nor 2</p>
<p><strong>17. Consider the following figures 1, 2, 3 and 4:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Directions for the following 8 (eight) items:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Read the following four passages and answer the items that follow each passage. Your answers to these items should be based on the passages only.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passage -1 </strong></p>
<p>The subject of democracy has become severely muddled because of the way the rhetoric surrounding it has been used in recent years, There IS, increasingly, an oddly confused dichotomy between those who want to 'impose' democracy on countries In the non-Western world (in these countries' 'own interest', of course) and those who are opposed to such 'imposition' (because of the respect for the countries' 'own ways'). But the entire language of 'imposition', used by both sides, is extraordinarily inappropriate since it makes the implicit assumption that democracy belongs exclusively to the West, taking it to be a quintessentially 'Western' idea which has originated and flourished only in the West.</p>
<p>But the thesis and the pessimism it generates about the possibility of democratic practice in the world would be extremely hard to justify. There were several experiments in local democracy in ancient India. Indeed, in understanding the roots of democracy in the world, we have to take an interest in the history of people participation and public reasoning in different parts of the world. We have to look beyond thinking of democracy only in terms of European and American evolution. We would fail to understand the pervasive demands for participatory living, on which Aristotle spoke with far-reaching insight, if we take democracy to be a kind of a specialized cultural product of the West.</p>
<p>It cannot, of course, be doubted that the institutional structure of the contemporary practice of democracy is largely the product of European and American experience over the last few centuries. This is extremely important to recognize since these developments in institutional formats were immensely innovative and ultimately effective. There can be little doubt that there is a major 'Western' achievement here.</p>
<p><strong>31. Which of the following is closest to the view of democracy as mentioned in the above passage?</strong>@#$%$#a) The subject of democracy is a muddle due to a desire to portray it as a Western concept, 'alien' to non-Western countries. @#$%$#b) The language or imposition of democracy is inappropriate. There is, however, a need to consider this concept in the backdrop of culture of 'own ways' of non-Western society. @#$%$#c) While democracy is not essentially a Western idea belonging exclusively to the West, the institutional structure of current democratic practices has been their contribution. @#$%$#d) None of the statements (a), (b) and (c) given above is correct.</p>
<p><strong>32. With reference to the passage, the following assumptions have been made:</strong>@#$%$#1. Many of the non-Western countries are unable to have democracy because they take democracy to be a specialized cultural product of the West. @#$%$#2. Western countries are always trying to impose democracy on non-Western countries.@#$%$#Which of the above is/are valid assumption/assumptions?@#$%$#a) 1 only @#$%$#b) 2 only @#$%$#c) Both 1 and 2 @#$%$#d) Neither 1 nor 2</p>
<p><strong>Passage - 2</strong></p>
<p>Corporate governance is based on principles such as conducting the business with all integrity and fairness, being transparent with regard to all transactions, making all the necessary disclosures and decisions, complying with all the laws of the land, accountability and responsibility towards the stakeholders and commitment to conducting business in an ethical manner. Another point which is highlighted on corporate governance is the need for those in control to be able to distinguish between what are personal and corporate funds while managing a company.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, there is a level of confidence that is associated with a company that is known to have good corporate governance. The presence of an active group of independent directors on the board contributes a great deal towards ensuring confidence m the market. Corporate governance is known to be one of the criteria that foreign institutional investors are increasingly depending on when deciding on which companies to invest in. It is also known to have a positive influence on the share price of the company. Having a clean image on the corporate governance front could also make it easier for companies to source capital at more reasonable costs. Unfortunately, corporate governance often becomes the centre of discussion only after the exposure of a large scam.</p>
<p><strong>33. According to the passage, which of the following should be the practice/practices in good corporate governance?</strong>@#$%$#1. Companies should always comply with labour and tax laws of the land. @#$%$#2. Every company in the country should have a government 'representative as one of the independent directors on the board to ensure transparency. @#$%$#3. The manager of a company should never invest his personal, funds in the company. @#$%$#Select the correct answer using the codes given below: @#$%$#a) 1 only @#$%$#b) 2 and 3 only @#$%$#c) 1 and 3 only @#$%$#d) 1, 2 and 3</p>
<p><strong>34. According to the passage, which of the following is/are the major benefit/benefits of good corporate governance? </strong>@#$%$#1. Good corporate governance leads to increase in share price of the company. @#$%$#2. A company with good corporate governance always increases its business turnover rapidly. @#$%$#3. Good corporate governance is the main criterion for foreign institutional investors when they decide to buy a company. @#$%$#Select the correct answer using the codes given below:@#$%$#a) 1 only @#$%$#b) 2 and 3 only @#$%$#c) 1 and 3 only @#$%$#d) 1, 2 and 3</p>
<p><strong>Passage - 3</strong></p>
<p>Malnutrition most commonly occurs between the ages of six months and two years. This happens despite the child's food requirements being less than that of an older child. Malnutrition is often attributed to poverty, but it has been found that even in households where adults eat adequate quantities of food, more than 50 per cent of children-under-five do not consume enough food. The child's dependence on someone else to feed him/her is primarily responsible for the malnutrition. Very often the mother is working and the responsibility of feeding the young child is left to an older sibling. It is therefore crucial to increase awareness regarding the child's food needs and how to satisfy them.</p>
<p><strong>35. According to the passage, malnutrition in children can be reduced </strong>@#$%$#a) if the children have regular intake of food. @#$%$#b) after they cross the age of five. @#$%$#c) if the food needs of younger children are known. @#$%$#d) if the responsibility of feeding younger children is given to adults.</p>
<p><strong>36. According to the author, poverty is not the main cause of malnutrition, but the fact that </strong>@#$%$#1. taking care of younger ones is not a priority for working mothers. @#$%$#2. awareness of nutritional needs is not propagated by the Public Health authorities. @#$%$#Select the correct answer using the code given below: @#$%$#a) 1 only @#$%$#b) 2 only @#$%$#c) Both 1 and 2 @#$%$#d) Neither 1 nor 2</p>
<p><strong>Passage - 4</strong></p>
<p>A number of empirical studies find that farmers are risk-averse, though only moderately in many cases. There is also evidence to show that farmers' risk aversion results in cropping patterns and input use designed to reduce risk rather than to maximize income. Farmers adopt a number of strategies to manage and cope with agricultural risks. These include practices like crop and field diversification, non-farm employment, storage of stocks and strategic migration of family members. There are also institutions ranging from share tenancy to kinship, extended family and informal credit agencies. One major obstacle to risk sharing by farmers is that the same type of risks can affect a large number of farmers in the region. Empirical studies show that the traditional methods are not adequate. Hence there is a need for policy interventions, especially measures that cut across geographical regions.</p>
<p>Policies may aim at tackling agricultural risks directly or indirectly. Examples of risk-specific policies arc crop insurance, price stabilization and the development of varieties resistant to pests and diseases. Policies which affect risk indirectly are irrigation, subsidized credit and access to information. No single risk-specific policy is sufficient to reduce risk and is without side-effects, whereas policies not specific to risk influence the general situation and affect risks only indirectly. Crop insurance, as a policy measure to tackle agricultural risk directly, deserves careful consideration in the Indian context and in many other developing countries because the majority of farmers depend on rain-fed agriculture and in many areas yield variability is the predominant cause of their income instability.</p>
<p><strong>37. The need for policy intervention to mitigate risks in agriculture is because </strong>@#$%$#a) farmers are extremely risk-averse. @#$%$#b) farmers do not know how to mitigate risks. @#$%$#c) the methods adopted by farmers and existing risk sharing institutions are not adequate. @#$%$#d) majority of farmers depend on rain-fed agriculture.</p>
<p><strong>38. Which of the following observations emerges from the above passage? </strong>@#$%$#a) One can identify a single policy that can reduce risk without any side-effect. @#$%$#b) No single risk-specific policy is sufficient to reduce agricultural risk. @#$%$#c) Policies which affect risk indirectly can eliminate it. @#$%$#d) Government's policy intervention can mitigate agricultural risk completely.</p>
<p><strong>39. Consider the following statements: </strong>@#$%$#I. A primary group is relatively smaller in size. @#$%$#II. Intimacy is an essential characteristic of a primary group. @#$%$#III. A family may be an example of a primary group.@#$%$#In the light of the above statements, which one of the following is true?@#$%$#a) All families are primary groups. @#$%$#b) All primary groups are families. @#$%$#c) A group of smaller size is always a primary group. @#$%$#d) Members of a primary group know each other intimately.</p>
<p><strong>40. Four friends, A, B, C and D distribute some money among themselves in such a manner that A gets one less than B, C gets 5 more than D, D gets 3 more than B. Who gets the smallest amount? </strong>@#$%$#a) A @#$%$#b) B @#$%$#c) C @#$%$#d) D</p>

<p>Read the following passage and answer the four items that follow. YOUI' answers to these items should be based on the passage only.</p>
<p><strong>Passage </strong></p>
<p>Financial markets J n India have acquired greater depth and liquidity over the years. Steady reforms since 1991 have led to growing linkages and integration of the Indian economy and its financial system with the global economy. Weak global economic prospects and continuing uncertainties the in international financial markets therefore, have had their impact on the emerging market economies. Sovereign risk concerns, particularly in the Euro area, affected financial markets for the greater part of the year, with the contagion of Greece's sovereign debt problem spreading to India and other economies by way of higher-than-normal levels of volatility.</p>
<p>The funding constraints in international financial markets could impact both the availability and cost of foreign funding for banks and corporates. Since the Indian financial system is bank dominated, banks' ability to withstand stress is critical to overall financial stability. Indian banks, however, remain robust, notwithstanding a decline in capital to risk-weighted assets ratio and a rise in non-performing asset levels in the recent past. Capital adequacy levels remain above the regulatory requirements. The financial market infrastructure continues to function without any major disruption. With further globalization, consolidation, deregulation, and diversification of the financial system, the banking business may become more complex and riskier. Issues like risk and liquidity management and enhancing skill therefore assume greater significance.</p>
<p><strong>54. According to the passage, the financial markets in the emerging market economies including India had the adverse impact in recent years due to </strong>@#$%$#1. weak global economic prospects. @#$%$#2. uncertainties in the international financial markets. @#$%$#3. sovereign risk concerns in the Euro area. @#$%$#4. bad monsoons and the resultant crop loss. @#$%$#Select the correct answer using the code given below: @#$%$#a) 1 and 2 only @#$%$#b) 1, 2 and 3 @#$%$#c) 2 and 3 only @#$%$#d) 2, 3 and 4</p>
<p><strong>55. The Indian financial markets are affected by global changes mainly due to the </strong>@#$%$#a) increased inflow of remittances from abroad. @#$%$#b) enormous increase in the foreign exchange reserves. @#$%$#c) growing global linkages and integration of the Indian financial markets. @#$%$#d) contagion of Greece's sovereign debt problem.</p>
<p><strong>56. According to the passage, in the Indian financial system, banks' ability to with stand stress is critical to ensure overall financial stability because Indian financial system is </strong>@#$%$#a) controlled by the Government of India. @#$%$#b) less integrated with banks. @#$%$#c) controlled by Reserve Bank of India. @#$%$#d) dominated by banks.</p>
<p><strong>57. Risk and liquidity management assumes more importance in the Indian banking system in future due to </strong>@#$%$#1. further globalization. @#$%$#2. more consolidation and deregulation of the financial system. @#$%$#3. further diversification of the financial system. @#$%$#4. more financial inclusion in the economy. @#$%$#Select the correct answer using the code given below: @#$%$#a) 1, 2 and 3 @#$%$#b) 2, 3 and 4 @#$%$#c) 1 and 2 only @#$%$#d) 3 and 4 only</p>

<p>Read the following passage and answer the two items that follow. Your answers to these items should be based on the passage only.</p>
<p><strong>Passage</strong></p>
<p>Crude mineral oil comes out of the earth as a thick brown or black liquid with a strong smell. It is a complex mixture of many different substances, each with its own individual qualities. Most of them are combinations of hydrogen and carbon in varying proportions. Such hydrocarbons are also found in other forms such as bitumen, asphalt and natural gas. Mineral oil originates from the carcasses of tiny animals and from plants that live in the sea. Over millions of years, these dead creatures form large deposits under the sea-bed; and ocean currents cover them with a blanket of sand and silt. As this mineral hardens, it becomes sedimentary rock and effectively shuts out the oxygen, so preventing the complete decomposition of the marine deposits underneath. The layers of sedimentary rock become thicker and heavier. Their pressure produces heat, which transforms the tiny carcasses into crude oil in a process that is still going on today.</p>
<p><strong>62. Mineral oil deposits under the sea do not get completely decomposed because they </strong>@#$%$#a) are constantly washed by the ocean currents. @#$%$#b) become rock and prevent oxygen from entering them. @#$%$#c) contain a mixture 'of hydrogen and carbon. @#$%$#d) are carcasses of organisms lying in saline conditions.</p>
<p><strong>63. Sedimentary rock leads to the formation of oil deposits because </strong>@#$%$#a) there are no saline conditions below it. @#$%$#b) it allows some dissolved oxygen to enter the dead organic matter below it. @#$%$#c) weight of overlying sediment layers causes the production of heat. @#$%$#d) it contains the substances that catalyze the chemical reactions required to change dead organisms into oil.</p>
<p><strong>64. In a class of 45 students, a boy is ranked 20th. When two boys joined, his rank was dropped by one. What is his new rank from the end? </strong>@#$%$#a) 25th @#$%$#b) 26th @#$%$#c) 27th @#$%$#d) 28th</p>
<p><strong>65. A thief running at 8 km/hr is chased by a policeman whose speed is 10 km/hr. If the thief is 100 m ahead of the policeman, then the time required for the policeman to catch the thief will be</strong> @#$%$#a) 2 min @#$%$#b) 3 min @#$%$#c) 4 min @#$%$#d) 6 min</p>

As we climbed higher, it became colder and rain began to fall, making it difficult at times to see the road. I asked John, my companion, to drive more slowly.

<p>A stout old lady was walking with her basket down the middle of a street in Petrograd to the great confusion of the traffic and no small peril to herself. It was pointed out to her that the pavement was the place for foot-passengers, but she replied, "I m going to walk where I like. We've got liberty now." It did not occur to the dear lady that if liberty entitled the foot-passenger to walk down the middle of the road it also entitled the taxi-driver to drive on the pavement, and that the end of such liberty would be universal chaos.
