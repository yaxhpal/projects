 <p class="answer"> 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4@#$%$# Employees’ State Insurance Scheme of India is an integrated social security scheme tailored to provide social protection to workers and their dependants, in the organised sector, in contingencies, such as, sickness, maternity and death or disablement due to an employment injury or occupational hazard.@#$%$# The ESI Act applies to any premises/precincts, where 10 or more persons are employed. A factory or an establishment located in a geographical area notified for implementation of the Scheme, falls under the purview of the Act. Employees of the aforesaid categories of factories and establishments, drawing wages upto Rs.15,000/- (w.e.f. 01.05.2010) a month, are entitled to social security cover under the ESI Act. The wage ceiling for purpose of coverage of employees is revised from time to time, to keep pace with rising cost of living and consequent wage hikes.@#$%$# The &quot;appropriate Government&quot; State or Central is empowered to extend the provisions of the ESI Act to various classes of establishments, industrial, commercial or agricultural or otherwise. Under these enabling provisions most of the State Govts have extended the ESI Act to certain specific class of establishments, such as, shops, hotels, restaurants, cinemas, preview theatres, motors transport undertakings and newspaper establishments etc., employing 20 or more persons. Further under section 1(5) of the Act, the Scheme has been extended to Private Medical and Educational institutions employing 20* or more persons in certain States/UTs. The correct answer of this question is 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4. </p> 
 
<p>5. According to the Constitution of India, it is the duty of the President of India to cause to be laid before the Parliament which of the following?@#$%$# 1. The Recommendations of the Union Finance Commission@#$%$# 2. The Report of the Public Accounts Committee@#$%$# 3. The Report of the Comptroller and <a href="http://www.gktoday.in/auditor/">Auditor</a> General@#$%$# 4. The Report of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes@#$%$# Select the correct answer using the codes given below :@#$%$# [A]1 Only@#$%$# [B]2 &amp; 4 Only@#$%$# [C]1, 3 &amp; 4 Only@#$%$# [D]1, 2, 3 &amp; 4@#$%$#</p> 

 <p class="answer"> 1, 3 &amp; 4 Only@#$%$# Finance Commission is obviously correct. CAG report is placed as per article 151. (1). NCSC is as per article 338. Public Account Committee is not@#$%$# there. So correct answer is 1, 3 &amp; 4 </p> 
 
<p>6. A deadlock between the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha calls for a joint sitting of the Parliament during the passage of@#$%$# 1. Ordinary Legislation@#$%$# 2. Money Bill@#$%$# 3. Constitution Amendment Bill@#$%$# Select the correct answer using the codes given below:@#$%$# [A]Only 1@#$%$# [B]2 &amp; 3 Only@#$%$# [C]1 &amp; 3 Only@#$%$# [D]1, 2 &amp; 3@#$%$#</p> 

 <p class="answer"> Only 1@#$%$# The article 368 says that the constitution amendment bills have to be passed by both houses individually. In case of any disagreement between the two Houses of Parliament on a Constitution Amendment Bill, there CANNOT be a joint sitting of the Houses of Parliament. Then how to move forward?@#$%$# You can not move forward in fact :) The fate of such bills is decided in this way only, no alternatives.</p> 
 <p>The makers of the constitution did not want that every now and then the MPS sit together and make changes in it. The idea is to make the &quot;constitution amendment difficult&quot; so that its value can be retained.</p> 
 <p>This means that the amending power of the parliament is subject to procedural check via the amending power itself. The procedure laid down in article 368 has basically imposed restriction on the parliament itself. You can imagine, how difficult is it to gain two third majority of members present and voting and then absolute majority of the total members of each house of the parliament. Please note that in past a CPI member Bhupesh Gupta had once brought forward a bill, which sought to amend the article 368 and provide for a joint sitting. It was not passed, because it itself was a Constitution amendment bill :) Then, a deadlock on Money Bill does not arises. Correct answer Only 1 </p>

DRDAs act as Panchayati Raj Institutions in certain specified backward regions of the country.@#$%$# 2.DRDAs undertake area-specific scientific study of the causes of poverty and malnutrition and prepare detailed remedial measures.@#$%$# 3.

 <p class="answer"> 3 &amp; 4 Only@#$%$# DRDA watch over and ensure effective utilization of the funds intended for anti-poverty programmes. Statement 4 is correct. Then, the endeavour and objective of the DRDAs is to secure inter-sectoral and inter-departmental coordination and cooperation for reducing poverty in the district. Statement 3 is correct. Only these two statements are correct in this question. So Correct Answer is 3 &amp; 4 ONLY. </p>

<p>9. What is the provision to safeguard the autonomy of the Supreme Court of India?@#$%$# 1. While appointing the Supreme Court Judges, the President of India has to consult the Chief Justice of India.@#$%$# 2. The Supreme Court Judges can be removed by the Chief Justice of India only.@#$%$# 3.

All appointments of officers and staffs of the Supreme court the Government only after consulting the Chief Justice of India.@#$%$# Which of the statements given above is/are correct?@#$%$# [A]1 &amp; 3 Only@#$%$# [B]3 &amp; 4 Only@#$%$# [C]4 Only@#$%$# [D]1, 2, 3 &amp; 4@#$%$#</p> 

 <p class="answer"> 1 &amp; 3 Only@#$%$# Let me analyse the statements one by one:@#$%$# Fist statement:@#$%$# While appointing the Supreme Court Judges, the President of India has to consult the Chief Justice of India@#$%$# We should note that that the mechanism for the appointment of judges to the high courts and the Supreme Court has changed after the 1993 and 1998 verdicts of the Supreme Court. Today, the Executive and Legislative organs of the State have no real role in the appointment of judges. According to Article 124 (2) of the Constitution, every judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President after consultations with such judges as the President may deem necessary. But in the case of the appointment of a judge other than the chief justice, Chief Justice of India shall always be consulted. The statement is correct and to a great extent, safeguards the autonomy of honourable Supreme Court of India.@#$%$# Second Statement:@#$%$# The Supreme Court Judges can be removed by the Chief Justice of India only.@#$%$# This is a wrong statement.@#$%$# As per Article 124 (4) the Judge of the Supreme Court shall not be removed from his office except by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two thirds of the members of that House present and voting has been presented to the President in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. Please also note that the provision for the removal of judges of the Supreme Court or high courts under Article 124 (4) for proven misbehaviour has become inoperative in practice, as has been proved in the Justice Ramaswamy impeachment case. There are no provisions to deal with deviant behaviour as distinct from “proven misbehaviour”. In other words, under the present dispensation, a judge is appointed solely on the recommendation of the judiciary and, for all practical purposes, no judge can ever be removed. To correct this absurd situation a national judicial commission with a decisive say in the appointment and removal of judges has been proposed.@#$%$# Third Statement:@#$%$# The salaries of the Judges are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India to which the legislature does not have to vote.This is a correct statement and most of you know about this.@#$%$# Fourth Statement:@#$%$# All appointments of officers and staffs of the Supreme court the Government only after consulting the Chief Justice of India.This is an incorrect statement. The Supreme Court Officers and Servants (Conditions of Service and Conduct) make different rulings, where the role of Government is actually nothing. The clause 6 says that all appointments of the Court Servants shall be made by Chief Justice in his absolute discretion.</p> 
 
<p>10. To meet its rapidly growing energy demand, some opine that India should pursue research and development on Thorium as the future fuel of nuclear energy. In this context, what advantage does Thorium hold over uranium?@#$%$# 1. Thorium is far more abundant in nature than uranium.@#$%$# 2. On the basis of per unit mass of mined mineral, thorium can generate more energy compared to natural uranium.@#$%$# 3. Thorium produces less harmful waste in comparison to uranium.@#$%$# Which of the statements given above is/are Correct?@#$%$# [A]1 Only@#$%$# [B]2 &amp; 3 Only@#$%$# [C]1 &amp; 3 Only@#$%$# [D]1,2 &amp; 3@#$%$#</p> 

 <p class="answer"> 1,2 &amp; 3@#$%$# Thorium fuel generates no new bomb-usable material in the waste profile; the waste consists of the radioisotope Uranium-233, or U233, which is virtually impossible to weaponize/ Thorium fuel will generate more energy per unit of mass than uranium fuel by a factor of approximately 30. Thorium is four times more abundant in nature than uranium, and is widely distributed throughout the Earth’s crust. All statements in this question are correct. </p> 
 
<p>11. The increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the air is slowly raising the temperature of the atmosphere, because it absorbs@#$%$# [A]the water vapour of the air and retains its heat@#$%$# [B] the ultraviolet part of the solar radiation@#$%$# [C]all the solar radiations@#$%$# [D]Infrared part of solar radiation@#$%$#</p>

<p>12. Which one of the following sets of elements was primarily responsible for the origin of life on the Earth?@#$%$# [A]Hydrogen, Oxygen, Sodium@#$%$# [B]Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen@#$%$# [C]Oxygen, Calcium, Phosphorus@#$%$# [D]Carbon, Hydrogen, Potassium@#$%$#</p> 

 <p class="answer"> Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen@#$%$# The correct answer of this question, as most of you know, is Carbon, Hydrogen and Nitrogen. In fact, the early biochemistry was not simply the reactions of Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Oxygen was bit far from it, was CO2, N and water resulting in the organic <a href="http://www.gktoday.in/acids/">acids</a> such as oxalic acid. </p> 
 
<p>13. What are the reasons for the people's resistance to the introduction of Bt brinjal in India?@#$%$# 1. Bt brinjal has been created by inserting a gene from a soil fungus into its genome.@#$%$# 2. The seeds of Bt brinjal are terminator seeds and therefore, the farmers have to buy the seeds before every season from the seed companies.@#$%$# 3. There is an apprehension that the consumption of Bt brinjal may have adverse impact on health.@#$%$# 4. There is some concern that the introduction of Bt brinjal may have adverse effect on the biodiversity.@#$%$# Select the correct answer using the codes given below :@#$%$# [A]1, 2 &amp; 3 Only@#$%$# [B]2 &amp; 3 only@#$%$# [C]3 &amp; 4 only@#$%$# [D]1,2,3 &amp; 4@#$%$#</p> 

 <p class="answer"> 3 &amp; 4 Only@#$%$# The first statement is incorrect. The second statement is also NOT correct. Bt Brinjal is NOT a terminator seed, as of now. <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/article317940.ece" target="_new&quot;">link</a> The third statement is obviously correct. The 4th statement is dubious but is a correct statement as it says --some concern that-- </p>

 <p class="answer"> 1, 2 &amp; 4 Only </p> 
 
<p>15. Consider the following statements: The most effective contribution made by Dadabhai Naoroji to the cause of Indian National Movement was that he@#$%$# 1. Exposed the economic exploitation of India by the British@#$%$# 2. Interpreted the ancient Indian texts and restored the self-confidence of Indians@#$%$# 3. Stressed the need for eradication of all the social evils before anything else@#$%$# Which among the above statements is/ are correct?@#$%$# [A]1 Only@#$%$# [B]2 &amp; 3 Only@#$%$# [C]1 &amp; 3 Only@#$%$# [D]1, 2 &amp; 3@#$%$#</p> 

 <p class="answer"> 1 Only@#$%$# The second statement is incorrect. Regarding third statement, we should note that Dadabhai Naoroji was a great social reformer of Bombay, who founded the Parsi Law Association. But when we say he stressed the eradication of &quot;all the social evils before anything else&quot; we are not justifying the role of Dadabhai naoroji. This is an incorrect statement. Correct answer of this question is Only 1 </p> 
 
<p>16. With reference to Dhrupad, one of the major traditions of India that has been kept alive for centuries, which of the following statements are correct?@#$%$# 1. Dhrupad originated and developed in the Rajput Kingdom period.@#$%$# 2. Dhrupad is primarily a devotional and spiritual music.@#$%$# 3. Dhrupad Alap uses Sanskrit syllables from Mantras@#$%$# Select the correct answer using the codes below:@#$%$# [A]1 &amp; 2 Only@#$%$# [B]2 &amp; 3 Only@#$%$# [C]1,2 &amp; 3 Only@#$%$# [D]None of the above is correct@#$%$#</p> 

 <p class="answer"> 2 &amp; 3 Only@#$%$# The first statement is incorrect. We are told that Dhrupad has its origin in back to Vedas period. The modern dhrupad probably descends from a form (dhurva) mentioned in the Na&macr;tyasha&macr;stra that developed in the Gwalior region (central Indo-Gangetic Plain) and probably reached a peak of popularity in the sixteenth century. Most dhrupads are religious in nature, praising Hindu gods (particularly Krishna) although some texts praise kings. The performance of dhrupad almost always begins with an introductory, free-time a&macr;la&macr;p, which can range from a brief affirmation of the melodic underpinnings of the performance (in religious contexts) to elaborate noteby- note explorations of the possibilities inherent in the <a href="http://www.gktoday.in/underlying/">underlying</a> pitch resources of ra&macr;ga (melody). The concert dhrupad a&macr;la&macr;p generally has two sections: the first (the a&macr;la&macr;p of the a&macr;la&macr;p) has the usual pattern of a growing pitch ambitus in free tempo, and the second (the nomtom or jor), an unmeasured, but pulsed, presentation of the ra&macr;ga. </p> 
 
<p>17. How do you distinguish between Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam dances?@#$%$# 1. Dancers occasionally speaking dialogues is found in Kuchipudi dance but not in Bharatanatyam.@#$%$# 2.

 <p class="answer"> Only 1@#$%$# The first statement is correct as Kuchipudi presents more realistic acting occasionally including dialogue spoken by the dancers. Another unique feature of Kuchipudi is the Tarangam, in which the performer dances on the edges of a brass plate, executing complicated rhythmic patterns with dexterity, while sometimes also balancing a pot of water on the head. So, second statement is incorrect. Correct answer is Only 1 </p> 
 
<p>18. With reference to the religious history of medieval India, the Sufi mystics were known to pursue which of the following practices?@#$%$# 1. Meditation and control of breath@#$%$# 2. Severe ascetic exercises in a lonely place@#$%$# 3. Recitation of holy songs to arouse a state of ecstasy in their audience@#$%$# Select the correct answer using the codes given below:@#$%$# [A]1 &amp; 2 Only@#$%$# [B]2 &amp; 3 Only@#$%$# [C]3 Only@#$%$# [D]1,2 &amp; 3@#$%$#</p> 

 <p class="answer"> 3 Only@#$%$# As far as meditation is concerned, Sufi practice Muraqaba which is a form of meditation only. This is not related to medieval history of India. First statement is incorrect. Second statement is also incorrect. Third is correct. Correct Answer Only 3.@#$%$# The question would invite a lot of research though. My answer has raised some counter questions also but we maintain our answer as correct. A few snippets / sources would suffice the reason, one of them is as follows:@#$%$#<img src="http://www.gktoday.in/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sufi.jpg" />@#$%$# source of above snippet is page <a href="http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dwzbYvQszf4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">This Book, Page 232</a></p>

<p>20. The Lahore Session of the Indian National Congress (1929) is very important in history, because:@#$%$# 1. The Congress passed a resolution demanding complete independence@#$%$# 2.

<p>21. With reference to National Rural Health Mission, which of the following are the jobs of 'ASHA', a trained community health worker?@#$%$# 1. Accompanying women to the health facility for antenatal care checkup@#$%$# 2. Using pregnancy test kits for early detection of pregnancy@#$%$# 3. Providing information on nutrition and immunization@#$%$# 4. Conducting the delivery of baby@#$%$#Select the correct answer using the codes given below :@#$%$# [A]1, 2 and 3 only@#$%$# [B]2 and 4 Only@#$%$# [C]1 and 3 only@#$%$# [D]1, 2, 3 &amp; 4@#$%$#</p> 

 <p class="answer"> 1, 2 and 3 only@#$%$# In this question, the 4th statement &quot;Conducting the <a href="http://www.gktoday.in/delivery/">delivery</a> of baby&quot; is not ASHA's job. The second option &quot;Using pregnancy test kits for early detection of pregnancy&quot;, the examiner wants to know whether you are aware of &quot;Nishchay&quot; or not. Under the NRHM, Government of India has introduced rapid home pregnancy test kits (Nishchay). Government is not promoting this as a pregnancy test kit alone, but is promoting it as an entry point to RCH and family planning services for women seeking quality and assured RCH and FP services. Now, the government has made these Nishchay pregnancy test kits available free of cost to all women in rural areas through the ASHAs, thus reaching out to women, who would otherwise have to travel great distances to confirm a pregnancy. A women in villages, who doubts that she might be pregnant can reach out to local ASHA and get &quot;Nischay&quot; free of cost. That is why this option is correct. So the correct answer of this question is 1, 2 &amp; 3 </p> 
 
<p>22. Which of the following is/are the principal feature(s) of the Government of India Act, 1919?@#$%$# 1. Introduction of dyarchy in the executive government of the provinces@#$%$# 2. Introduction of separate communal electorates for Muslims@#$%$# 3. Devolution of legislative authority by the centre to the provinces@#$%$# Select the correct answer using the codes given below:@#$%$# [A]1 only@#$%$# [B]2 and 3 only@#$%$# [C]1 and 3 only@#$%$# [D]1, 2 &amp; 3@#$%$#</p> 

 <p class="answer"> 1 and 3 only@#$%$# The first statement is correct in this question. Second statement is incorrect because first statutory recognition of separate electorates for Muslims was contained in the Act of 1909. In 1919, the British went ahead and gave separate electorates to Sikhs, Anglo-Indians, Christians and Europeans. So second statement is incorrect. Third statement which says &quot;Devolution of legislative authority by the centre to the provinces&quot; is correct. Government of India Act 1919 which gave the provinces more legislative powers provided for the framing of rules for the devolution of authority between the Centre and the Provinces. However, judicial review was prohibited. The correct answer of this question would be : 1 &amp; 3 only. You may read about Government of India Act 1919 <a href="http://www.gktoday.in/government-of-india-act-1919/" target="_new">Here</a> </p> 
 
<p>23. During Indian freedom struggle, the National Social Conference was formed. What was the reason for its formation?@#$%$# [A]Different social reform groups or organizations of Bengal region united to form a single body to discuss the issues of larger interest and to prepare appropriate petitions/representations to the government@#$%$# [B]Indian National Congress did not want to include social reforms in its deliberations and decided to form a separate body for such a purpose@#$%$# [C]Behramji Malabari and M. G. Ranade decided to bring together all the social reform groups of the country under one organization@#$%$# [D]None of the statements (a), (b) and (c) given above is correct in this context@#$%$#</p> 

 <p class="answer"> B is correct answer@#$%$# The three options given in this question are so close, that one would need to analyze each of them very carefully. The first statement is incorrect, because &quot;appropriate petitions/representations&quot; were the political functions, far from the objectives of National Social Conference. The second statement &quot; Indian National Congress did not want to include social reforms in its deliberations and decided to form a separate body for such a purpose&quot; is a CORRECT statement. Please note that when Congress was founded in 1885 in Bombay, its organizers had a feeling that along with the political topic, a place should be given to the discussion of social topics also. So, R. Raghunath Rao and M G Ranade addressed the congress on subjects related to social reforms. But on a second consideration, the organizers of Congress felt that the Congress Platform should be devoted to political topics only. As those interested in the social freforms, also felt in a need for it, so it was decided to inaugurate the National Social Conference as a separate movement. Here we should also note that hostility to social-reform issues expressed by a majority of nationalists in the congress had led to the formation of the Indian National Social Conference. The National Social Conference met annually from 1887 to 1895 as part of the INC Sessions. </p> 
 <p>Now lets, discuss the third statement. This statement is the very soul of the National Social Conference but has been presented by your examiner in an incorrect way. It is true that the objective of the National Social Conference was to strengthen the forces of reform by bringing together every year in the representatives of various associations and movements scattered all over India , that were struggling against the social evils. Yet, the two names given by UPSC in this question are incorrect, that leads me to eliminate this option. Please note that the conference was founded by MG Ranade an Raghunath Rao. Behram Ji Malabari in those days was working against Infant Marriage and Enforced Widowhood. So, the correct answer of this question is B. </p>

 <p class="answer"> 1,3 &amp; 4 Only@#$%$# Lets analyze these statements:@#$%$# 1. Different kinds of specialized surgical instruments were in common use by 1st century AD.@#$%$# This is an correct statement. We have been told that in ancient India, it was Sushrut who is known to be the first surgeon. He not only used the S type and U type surgical instruments but also has documented plastic surgery. However, historians have not been able to assign a definite period to Sushruta. The era of Sushrut is most probably BC and definitely it was prior to 1st century AD.@#$%$# 2. Transplant of internal organs in the human body had begun by the beginning of 3rd century AD.@#$%$# Sushruta mentioned the plastic surgery in which the flaps of nose skins were used to replace at other parts.

 <p class="answer"> 1, 2 &amp; 3@#$%$# In the Ryotwari Settlement, it was theoretically proposed that annual agreements would have to be made with the cultivators. If the cultivators would agree, they would get Pattas. As per the system, Government was the Supreme landlord and the peasants were Land Owners, who obtained the title / patta by paying annual cash rents ot revenue assessment directly to the Government. Statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is also correct. Please note that a special state fee called Nazarana was charged for giving occupancy rights ot Pattas. </p> 
 <p>The third statement is also correct. In the Ryotwari System, the land revenue was assessed according to the fertility of land. The average assessment payable in cash was around Re. 1 per acre. However, practically, this was not done. If the system were efficient by making the surveys and assessment of the lands, the Ryotwari System would not have failed probably. The lands were taxes on guesswork and that is why peasants came under stress. This was the major reason of failure of Ryotwari System. </p>

 <p class="answer"> 2 3 1@#$%$# This is a very easy question. Economic Development means improved living conditions. Improved living conditions means low birth rate and low death rate. For example, we can say that India has achieved impressive demographic transition owing to the decline of crude birth rate, crude death rate, total fertility rate and infant mortality rate. Now, to arrange the above three, you may look at the following chart: <img src="http://www.gktoday.in/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/death-rate-demographic-tran.jpg" />@#$%$# Accordingly the correct answer would be 2 3 1 </p>

<p>87. Consider the following agricultural practices:@#$%$# 1. Contour bunding@#$%$# 2. Relay cropping@#$%$# 3.

 <p class="answer"> 1,2 &amp; 3@#$%$# Any method which helps the soil to retain more organic matter , so that it may work as an effective Carbon sink would be helpful in Carbon sequestrian or storage. The question gives you three options which you need to analyze one by one: </p> 
 <p>Contour Bunding:@#$%$# Contour bunding Contour bunding is one of the extensively used soil and water conservation technique in several rainfed areas. Contour bunding is a mechanical measure which minimizs the soil erosion. Contour bunding involves the construction of small bunds across the slope of the land along a contour so that the long slope is reduced to a series of small ones. The contour bund acts as a barrier to flow of water down a slope and thus the benefit is that it increases the time so that water concentrates in an area and this more water is absorbed. The question is; whether the contour bunding helps in carbon sequestrian or not. The answer is YES. Contour bunding increases the water holding capacity while minimizing the surface evaporation. Then soil erosion is minimized, and surface residues favour the nutrient recycling and result in higher carbon storage in the soil. This is a correct option. </p> 
 <p>Relay Cropping:@#$%$# Relay cropping means that new a crop is planted or sown before the previous one is harvested. This can provide advantages for both crops as one of them may provide nitrogen, shade, support or may discourage pests. The obvious benefit of Relay cropping is soil conservation. Then, relay cropping helps in better yield and also helps in solid conservation. It does help in Carbon Sequestrian. This is also a correct answer. </p> 
 <p>Zero Tillage:@#$%$# Zero tillage is also based upon the premise of soil conservation, basic premise is to minimize the disturbances to the soil leading to an increase in retention of water, nutrients and topsoil itself. No-till has carbon sequestration potential through storage of soil organic matter in the soil of crop fields.@#$%$# Thus, we conclude that all options help in carbon storage and correct answer is C that is 1, 2 &amp; 3@#$%$# One more thing I would like to tell you. These practices are called C-Enhancement Practices (CEP).  CEPs consist of a single technology or practice aimed at conserving or enhancing carbon stock in selected land categories. Potential CEPs are mulching, organic manure application, green manure application, reduced or zero tillage, contour bunding, farm ponds, tank silt application, intercropping or multiple cropping, and cover cropping. :) </p>
