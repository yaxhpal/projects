  "artBookBio" : "Swedish painter. Gösta Adrian-Nilsson (GAN) studied at Zahrtmanns Skole, Copenhagen and travelled to Berlin in 1914 in order to assimilate the latest trends in the European avant-garde, through Herwath Walden’s Galerie Der Sturm. At this time both Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc were of great importance to his development of an abstracted style combined with use of deep, glowing colours. In 1916 he moved to Stockholm where he developed his own style of expressive Cubism (e.g. Sailors’ War Dream, 1917; Malmö Konstmuseum). His dynamic, geometrically determined reflections on contemporary urban existence secured his reputation as the first artist to introduce abstract art to Sweden, in works such as this 1921 Kubistisk Composition which combines figurative and still life elements with interweaving areas of colour, pattern and a dynamic diagonal thrust.\n",
