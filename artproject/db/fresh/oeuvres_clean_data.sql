Gösta Adrian-Nilsson (GAN) studied at Zahrtmanns Skole, Copenhagen and travelled to Berlin in 1914 in order to assimilate the latest trends in the European avant-garde, through Herwath Walden’s Galerie Der Sturm. At this time both Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc were of great importance to his development of an abstracted style combined with use of deep, glowing colours. In 1916 he moved to Stockholm where he developed his own style of expressive Cubism (e.g. Sailors’ War Dream, 1917; Malmö Konstmuseum). His dynamic, geometrically determined reflections on contemporary urban existence secured his reputation as the first artist to introduce abstract art to Sweden, in works such as this 1921 Kubistisk Composition which combines figurative and still life elements with interweaving areas of colour, pattern and a dynamic diagonal thrust.\n\nLike the Futurists, Gösta Adrian-Nilsson was captivated by modern technology, seeking to unite this Italian movement’s worship of the machine with Kandinsky’s esoteric thought. In 1919 he began producing purely non-objective work and he made numerous collages around 1920 in a Dadaist style. Between 1920 and 1925 he lived in Paris, coming into contact with Albert Gleizes, Alexander Archipenko and, crucially, Fernand Léger. In his designs for ballet costumes as much as his paintings, Adrian-Nilsson was much influenced by Léger, his studio neighbour in Montparnasse. He was especially struck by the Frenchman’s robotic machine-like sculptures, hybrids of abstracted human contours and mechanical apparatus that celebrated the machine age but also contained primitive elements.\n\nThis hugely ambitious composition of 1922 incorporates sailors, ships and musical notation within a fractured landscape referencing both exotic travel and industrial architecture. \n\nIn addition to his Cubo-Futurist-inspired works, Adrian-Nilsson also produced geometric abstract work later on in the 1920s. At this time he became highly influential as a painter, in particular, on compatriots Sven Jonson and Esaias Thorén, whom he met in the year he created Inspiration (1928). \n\nIn the 1930s he developed a personal approach to Surrealism, participating in exhibitions such as Kubisme-Surrealisme in Copenhagen (1935). During the 1940s his work again became purely abstract. Adrian-Nilsson was influential among members of the Halmstad Group (Halmstadgrupper), particularly during their Surrealist phase. His later work, inspired by the Swedish landscape painter Marcus Larson, changed again and moved closer in spirit to Romantic painting. His work, signed ‘GAN’, is represented in many public collections including the Moderna Museet Stockholm, the Göteborgs Konstmuseum and the Malmö Konstmuseum.','Sweden','Gösta','Adrian-Nilsson',1884,1965,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6sta_Adrian-Nilsson',1),(2,'Swedish painter.

Members of the Pont-Aven School searched for a more expressive, simplified art for which the ‘Primitive’ associations of Brittany provided a ready stimulus. Aguéli only painted in two discrete periods: the first from 1890 to 1895; the second from 1911 until his death in 1917. In the interim, Aguéli led a nomadic existence in France and in the Far East, where he studied religion and Sufism, before converting to Islam in 1898. In 1900 he shot and wounded a banderillero at a bullfight in Paris in protest against cruelty to animals. \n\nIn the autumn of 1894 he went to Egypt and began painting intensively, producing such works as Egyptian Landscape (1894/5; Stockholm, Nationalmuseum). From 1902 to 1909 he lived in Egypt, working as a newspaper editor and for the most part neglecting art. Travelling to Paris in 1910 he became interested in Cubism and met Pablo Picasso and Fernand Léger. He took up painting again in Stockholm the following year, concentrating on figurative compositions with such works as Standing Female Model (1911; Stockholm, Nationalmuseum) and portraits such as this elegant example of a woman in profile. He became an art critic upon his return to Paris in 1912. By 1916 Aguéli was totally deaf. The following year, while waiting to take a ship to Sweden from Barcelona, he was run over by a train.\n\nAguéli was the first Swedish painter to be influenced by Synthetism in his landscapes, figure paintings and portraits. He was aware, well before his Swedish contemporaries, of the art of Paul Cézanne and Vincent van Gogh. His precisely proportioned paintings are balanced by his exceptional sensitivity to colour and often attain greater intensity through their small format. The best collections of Aguéli’s works are in the Aguéli Museum at Sala, the Moderna Museet and Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde, Stockholm, and the Göteborgs Konstmuseum.','Sweden','Ivan','Aguéli',1869,1917,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Agu%C3%A9li',1),(3,'Belgian painter, draughtsman, printmaker and filmmaker. Pierre Alechinsky studied book illustration and typography at the Cambre École Nationale Supérieure des Arts (in Brussels) from 1944 to 1946. In 1947 he became a member of the Jeune Peinture Belge group and had his first solo exhibition at the Galerie Lou Cosyn in Brussels. In 1949 he became a founder member of the CoBrA (Copenhagen, Brussels, Amsterdam) movement after meeting Christian Dotremont. With a number of artist friends he set up the Ateliers du Marais, a research centre and meeting place in Brussels. Towards the end of 1951 he went to Paris, moving to Japan in 1955 to study the art of calligraphy, also making a film called Calligraphie Japonaise (1956). Alechinsky adopted the Oriental manner of painting, whereby the paper is spread on the floor and the artist leans over the work holding the bottle of ink, allowing a greater freedom of movement. In 1957 he made his first large works on paper in Indian ink and afterwards mounted the paper on canvas, a medium and process he would continue with until much later in his career in prints and works on paper such as this highly abstract work from 1988, Muted Response.\n\n\nAlechinsky’s monumental oil painting The Last Day (1964; Antwerp, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten) forms the climax of his membership of CoBrA and is also an homage to James Ensor. The figures in the picture are scattered over the surface like pieces of thread, colourful and fresh. A work characteristic of his narratives is Central Park, a painting begun in New York in 1965. It is painted in acrylics, and the colourful centre is surrounded by a border containing black and white drawings in Indian ink. From 1972 Alechinsky began to use ink in the centre, reserving colour for the edges. The use of paper, brushes and ink or quick-drying acrylic paint enabled him to render his images spontaneously one next to the other, almost at random. His pictures contain volcanic eruptions flowing into one another, monsters, deep rifts, grotesque snakes, waterfalls, lively clouds and birds. He often used pieces of paper that had previously served some other purpose, such as legal documents, invoices and bonds, on which he left his marks. Alechinsky was fascinated by anything related to printmaking and continually experimented with new ideas; in Seismographic Armful (lithograph with logogram, 1972; New York, Guggenheim) he collaborated with Dotremont who created the logogram which Alechinsky surrounded with his characteristic border.','Belgium','Pierre','Alechinsky',1927,-1,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Alechinsky',1),(4,'American artist. Hans Albin Amelin Agaton was born in Chicago, Illinois. He studied at the Technical School in Stockholm before moving to Paris to continue his training. His first exhibition was in 1929 and in 1932 he became one of the founding members of Färg och Form (Colour and Form), an artist-run gallery and association of Swedish artistsunited by their responses to the economic crisis of the 1930s. They sold directly to the public through their exhibition space located at Stureplan in Stockholm, thus circumnavigating the system of dealers. This 1937 Group Study shows that Amelin was interested in much else besides mere colour and form, however, combining as it does figures, movement, as well as the depiction of industry and nature, in one cohesive narrative.\n\nBeing politically motivated and leftwards-leaning,Amelin used the working man as a regular subject but he also produced still lifes and landscapes in an Expressionist style. He was known for his rich colours and powerfully rendered impastoed paintwork, with the felled trees and raging river of Norrforsen representing a typical example of this more lyrical and naturalistic output. He died in Barrevik, Orust, Sweden in 1975. His work can be seen in the collections of Malmö Konstmuseum, Norrköpings Konstmuseum and Moderna Museet, Stockholm.','America','Albin','Amelin',1902,1975,1,'',1),(5,'Ghanaian sculptor. Born in Ghana in 1944, El Anatsui now lives and works in Nigeria. El Anatsui’s work often makes use of found objects, however his practice is concerned with transforming rather than merely recycling or salvaging and so seeks meaning in the ways everyday materials can be repurposed to make statements about history, culture and memory.\n\nInitially El Anatsui worked with wood and ceramic. In 1978 he began his Broken Pots series, where works were made of shards fused together with a form of cement. Making art historical references to Nok terracotta sculptures, West African myths concerning the earth and cultural references to clay use, Anatsui’s ceramic sculptures speak of regeneration through memory and the piecing together of shattered ideas and histories to form a new whole. In 2002 he started working with discarded liquor bottle tops, the medium of Healer (shown here). Using thousands of these tops, each one is flattened, punctured and then stitched together with copper wire to form vibrant hanging ‘cloths’ or sculptures. The finished work appears to transform a rigid, metal material into something that looks malleable and luxurious. Its construction also means that each time it is hung it takes on a slightly different sculptural form through a changing of folds and creases – this is something which appeals to El Anatsui. Ghana is home to some of the most diverse and vibrant traditions of textile production and El Anatsui is very aware of the symbolic and signifying potential of cloth. He has said, ‘Cloth is to the African what monuments are to Westerners...Their capacity and application to commemorate events, issues, persons and objectives outside of themselves are so immense (2005; London, October). Healer, with its complex patterns, stunning colours and geometric shapes is reminiscent of traditional kente cloth of the Ashanti people of Ghana. A further level of meaning is brought to this work by its being made from gin and whisky bottle tops, the hard spirits whose destructive qualities have often plagued societies. Added to this, gin largely replaced cowries as the common currency in Lagos in the 19thcentury and its possession conferred social status.\n\nAnatsui’s work was brought to pre-eminence by the 2005 exhibition Africa Remix: Contemporary Art of a Continent,and one of the works was draped across the Palazzo Fortuny at the 52nd Venice Biennale in 2007. His work is in many collections, including the British Museum, London, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. From 2010 to 2012 El Anatsui’s solo exhibition: El Anatsui: When I Last Wrote To You About Africa toured to five museums in North America.','Ghana','El','Anatsui',1944,-1,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Anatsui',1),(6,'Dutch painter, sculptor, designer, printmaker and writer. Born in Amsterdam, Christiaan Karel Appel was first encouraged to paint by an uncle, who gave him a set of paints for his 15th birthday, before he began training in art. From 1940 to 1943 he studied at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam, where he became friendly with Pierre Corneille. His earliest works recalled the painting of George Hendrik Breitner; during World War II, however, he began to paint with a more vigorous palette, with a clear interest in German Expressionism and above all in the work of Vincent van Gogh. There was a turning point in Appel’s style from about 1945 when he found inspiration in the art of the École de Paris and in particular of Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, whose exemplary bold shapes and freeform brushstrokes are discernible in this 1951 canvas of Birds in Flight, which also displays some Surrealist tendencies. This French influence remained visible in his work until 1948, for example in a series of plaster sculptures that he made at this time. \n\nIn July 1948 Appel, Constant Nieuwenhuys and Pierre Corneille were among the founders of the Experimentele Groep in Holland. In Paris in November of the same year Appel was also one of the founders of the international CoBrA (Copenhagen, Brussels, Amsterdam) movement. The contacts resulting from this movement, especially with the Danish members of the group, encouraged Appel to continue in the Primitivistic vein upon which he had already embarked. His most important source of inspiration during this period was emphatically children’s art and, from 1947, his completely personal, brightly coloured universe of simple, childlike beings and friendly animals began to populate his gouaches, oil pastel drawings, painted wood sculptures, and, gradually, oil paintings. This naïve influence in subsequent work, including this doll-like Figure lithograph of 1970, became a source of both indignation and revulsionin the critical reception of Appel’s practice, particularly in his native Netherlands. \n\nAt the end of 1950 Appel moved to Paris. In 1952, with better painting materials at this disposal (thanks to the support of the writer and art promoter Michel Tapié), his work became more fluent. Somewhat rigid, thinly applied areas of colour linked by a few thick lines had dominated his compositions since 1950, making them strongly reminiscent of the work of Joan Miró, but from 1952 to 1960 he increasingly adopted a passionate style in which colour and line fused into an agitated mass of paint so as to take precedence over the motifs. Animals and human beings were still recognisable in these paintings, as they would continue to be in examples such as this cheerful, brightly-coloured pachyderm hailing from Appel’s 1977 ‘Circus’ series, although they more often assumed an unchained, demonic character underneath their delightful Primitivism.\n\nOnly from the mid-1950s did Appel finally begin to acquire a considerable international reputation. Martha Jackson exhibited his work regularly from 1954; Appel also had one-man shows in Paris at Studio Facchetti and at Galerie Rive Droite from 1956. Willem Sandberg provided him with powerful support from The Netherlands, and, through Sandberg’s intervention, Appel took part in a series of international group shows, also having retrospectives of his work in prominent museums in various countries. In 1960 he received the international Guggenheim award for his painting Woman and Ostrich (1957; Amsterdam, Stedelijk Museum).\n\n\nIn France in summer 1961, Appel produced a series of sculptures from olive trunks, which he painted in brilliant colours. In 1963 he was briefly influenced by Pop Art and incorporated all sorts of objects, including plastic toys, in his paintings. From the mid-1950s he also produced reliefs and freestanding pieces in ceramic. While he preferred acrylic paints for his canvases in these years, he began again to use oil paints in 1976, at which point he attempted a conscious renewal of his style. To this end he spent some time painting compositions in thick parallel strokes; his subjects included cats, still lifes and mask-like faces, a haunting carnivalesque example of which features in this engraving from the ‘Circus’ suite.\n\nAround 1980 Appel rediscovered the turbulent Expressionistic language with which he had reached a high point in the second half of the 1950s. Working in turn in his studio and in New York and from 1979 in his house in Monaco, he began to paint, in a muted palette, a varied assortment of dramatic subjects with human figures as the central theme.\n\nAppel was famed for his flamboyant self-promotion and was tireless in his exploration of new media; after World War II he even wrote poetry. He received many large-scale commissions, including mural paintings, sculptures, stained-glass windows, carpets and tile pictures, which were produced either by Appel or by assistants.He died in 2006 athis home in Zürich','Holland','Christiaan Karel','Appel',1921,2006,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Appel',1),(7,'Israeli designer, teacher and artist. Ron Arad was born 1951 in Tel Aviv and studied at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, Jerusalem, and at the Architectural Association, London. In 1981 Arad founded One Off Ltd, a design studio, workshop and showroom in Covent Garden, London with Caroline Thorman, where they handcrafted unconventional furnishings and distinctive sculptural forms mostly out of welded steel sheeting. In 1989, again with Thorman and this time also with the Canadian architect Alison Brooks, he founded Ron Arad Associates, an architecture and design practice in Chalk Farm. In 1994 he established the Ron Arad Studio in Como, Italy and taught product design as a guest professor at the the Technische Universität Wien, Austria until 1997. From 1997-2009 he held a professorship for furniture design and industrial design at the Royal College of Art in London.\n\nSince the beginning of his career, as the idiosyncratic creator of popular and coveted objects and unusual spaces, Arad has moved freely among milieus – the lobby of an opera house, a collectable limited edition chaise longue, and an unlimited industrially produced lamp. One of his earliest and most famous designs is the 1981 Rover Chair, for which Arad scavenged and then recycled used car seats. He has long had an interest in the use of steel, and the Bookwork Bookshelves (1996), which are made from plastic by the Italian Kartell firm, were originally produced in a limited edition in steel. \n\nArad’s work is represented in the permanent collections of many museum around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and Vitra Design Museum, Weil am Rhein, Germany.','Israel','Ron','Arad',1952,-1,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Arad_(industrial_designer)',1),(8,'American sculptor. Born in France but later taking American citizenship, Armand Fernandez lived in Nice until 1949, studying at the École des Arts Décoratifs from 1946. In 1947 he met Yves Klein, with whom he was later closely associated in the Nouveau Réalisme movement. In 1949 he moved to Paris where he studied at the École du Louvre and where, in an exhibition in 1954, he discovered the work of Kurt Schwitters which led him to reject the lyrical abstraction of the period. In 1955 Arman began producing Stamps, using ink-pads as critique of Art Informel and Abstract Expressionism to suggest a depersonalised and mechanical version of paintings. In his next series, the Gait of Objects, from 1958, he took his rejection of the subjectivity of the personal mark by throwing inked objects against the canvas.\n\nArman’s willingness to embrace chance was indicated by his decision in 1958 to change his name in accordance with a printing error, having already stopped using his surname, Fernandez, in 1947. This attitude was consistent with that of his work, which by the late 1950s had moved away from traditional painting and sculpture in favour of the object and specifically of the ready-made as defined by Marcel Duchamp.\n\nFor his Accumulations, Arman piled up identical salvaged objects, modifying their meaning by repetition and giving the construction an ironic title, as with the accumulation of gas masks, Home Sweet Home (1960; Paris, Pompidou). He continued this aesthetic of detritus and scrap in another particularly provocative group of works, the Dustbins–transparent containers in which he placed either rubbish he had collected or objects that had belonged to a friend, as in Robot-portrait of Yves Klein, The Monochrome(1960). He soon widened his vocabulary by choosing not only to cut the objects into thin strips, revealing their internal structure, but even to destroy them violently during Rages held in public as a kind of performance art. From the mid-1960s Arman made numerous visits to New York, and he soon came to regard the USA as his second home, taking American citizenship in 1972.','America','Arman (Armand)','Fernandez',1928,2005,1,'',1),(9,'English sculptor. Kenneth Armitage was born in 1916, attended Leeds College of Art (1934-7) and on a scholarship to study at the Slade School of Fine Art, London (1937-9). In World War II he served in the British Army, and between 1946 and 1956 was Head of Sculpture at Bath Academy of Art; he also held a Gregory Fellowship in sculpture at Leeds University (1953-5). Armitage’s first works were carved in stone, in emulation of Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth, but in the post-war years he modelled with plaster on metal armatures, then cast in bronze. Flat Standing Figure was one of four pieces Armitage elected to exhibit at the Venice Biennale in 1952. It was shown beside those by other young British sculptors whose work signalled a new, anti-monumental, Expressionist approach, including Reg Butler, Lynn Chadwick, Eduardo Paolozzi and William Turnbull. This exhibition was a sell-out, propelling Armitage from a relative unknown to an internationally recognised artist in weeks. His purchasers included Peggy Guggenheim, Italian fashion designer Madame Schiaparelli and the Museums of Modern Art in New York and Rome.Armitage created small-scale figures, full of droll humour, with broad, flattened bodies, pinheads and sprouting, stick-like limbs. But Flat Standing Figure differs from other sculptures of this period, in that it evokes a sense of complete stillness. Like his contemporaries, Roger Hilton and William Scott, he approached the figure with a distinctly Modernist aesthetic. At that time, all three artists were absorbed with the simplification and abstraction of the human figure. The linear simplicity of Flat Standing Figure belies its formal complexity. Armitage plays with the traditional notion of sculpture as something voluminous or three dimensional. When viewed from the front, its apparent bulk promises a substantial form, yet the incredibly thin profile encourages one to simultaneously read the form as a silhouette. \n\nFlat Standing Figure (in other casts) has appeared in the following exhibitions: Kenneth Armitage & William Scott, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam (1959); Kenneth Armitage, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London (1959); Kenneth Armitage: 60 Years of Sculpture and Drawing, Jonathan Clark, London (2001).\n\nArmitage’s first solo exhibitions were held at Gimpel Fils, London (1952), and at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery, New York (1954). In 1955-7 he changed to working in clay, and in the 1960s he employed wax, resins and aluminium, and his pieces became darker in mood and more abstract. During the late 1960s and early 1970s he made a series of disembodied limbs and ‘furniture-figures’. He also experimented with drawn, screen-printed and photographic figural images on three-dimensional surfaces. Between 1975 and 1986 he moved from the figure to nature in his series of sculptures and drawings of oak trees in Richmond Park, London. Armitage’s works appear in collections around the world including the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice, MoMA, New York and the Tate, London.','England','Kenneth','Armitage',1916,2002,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Armitage',1),(10,'Frenchsculptor, painter, collagist, printmaker and poet. Born in 1886 in German Alsace, Jean Arp was a pioneer of abstract art and one of the founders of Dada in Zürich, but he also participated actively in both Surrealism and Constructivism. While he prefigured Junk art and the Fluxus movement in his incorporation of waste material, it was through his investigation of biomorphism and of chance and accident that he proved especially influential on later 20th-century art. Arp’s attempt to liberate the unconscious creative forces can be seen in the dreamily interlocking segments and suggestively psychological forms of the two closely related abstract gouaches shown here. Arp was a founder member of the Moderne Bund in Lucerne, participating in their exhibitions from 1911 to 1913. Through his collaboration with Der Blaue Reiter in Munich and Der Sturm in Berlin, Arp developed his international contacts. In 1915 he met artist Sophie Taeuber whose personality and work greatly influenced him and whom he married in 1922.\n\nArp belonged to the Dada movement from its very beginning in February 1918. For him it represented the reconciliation of man with nature and the integration of art into life. From 1917 he and his wife Sophie Taeuber were also involved in a utopian community, Monte Verità, at Ascona, Switzerland, and in 1918 they rejoined the Neue Leben group in Basel that was seeking to give artists a social function, much as Dada was doing in Berlin. In 1928, after collaborating with Theo van Doesburg and Taeuber for two years on the renovation of Café de l’Aubette in Strasbourg and becoming a French national, Arp built a house at Clamart near Paris. This later became the centre of the Fondation Arp. \n\nIn spite of his involvement with the Surrealists, Arp, like his wife Sophie Taeuber, had close links with Constructivist groups and artists around Europe such as De Stijl and Abstraction-Création, both of which had a common desire to create a counterbalance to Surrealism, as well as to change society and prepare the way towards a better future for mankind. In his sculptures, as in his other work, Arp linked together humans and animals, vegetable and inanimate objects, the organic and the inorganic, but in his later career he developed variations on these favourite themes, with darting forms becoming increasingly frequent. The search for a greater renunciation linked to verticality and symmetry gave an archetypal dimension to his later works, expressing his continuing search for a deeper spirituality. \n\nThis hand-woven wool rug is closely based on Arp’s 1928 gouacheComposition – Cercle Rouge also held in this collection (see previous page). It reveals the now fully integrated influence of his wife Sophie Taeuber, a design artist and previous student of textile techniques. Initially Arp collaborated with Taeuber on non-symmetrical collages and embroideries, patterned in squares and using muted colours (Duo-Collages, 1916-8). In the year Cercle Rouge was painted the couple, along with Theo van Doesburg, had created a pioneering and very public integration of art and function via their interior design for Strasbourg’s Café de l’Aubette. \nArp never shied away from trying out unusual methods and material, fully embracing Surrealism during the 1920s and 1930s: his works included reliefs made from driftwood (e.g. Travel Kit of the Shipwrecked, 1923), old newspapers (e.g. Disabled and Stateless Person, 1936; Venice, Guggenheim) or string stitched on to canvas (e.g. Man at the Window, 1930).','France','Jean','Arp',1886,1966,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_arp',1),(11,'Britishpainter and printmaker. After being born in Berlin, Auerbach was sent to England in 1939 and moved from school in Kent to London in 1947, where he attended art classes at Hampstead Garden Suburb Institute and began acting in fringe theatre. From 1947 to 1948 he studied at Borough Polytechnic under David Bomberg, whose teaching was especially valuable in its emphasis on risk and on seeking organic, unified forms. Auerbach continued in Bomberg’s evening life classes while at St Martin’s School of Art, London (1948-52). He considered his first original achievement to have been Summer Building Site of a scene at Earls Court; this was rather geometric and painted in formal, prismatic colour, but much of his early work was thickly and laboriously impastoed in earth colours, as is thisHead of E.O.W, a portrait of one of his regular models, Estella West (other versions of which are at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio; the Tate, London and the National Gallery of Scotland). He studied from 1952 to 1955 at the Royal College of Art, London and had his debut exhibition at the Beaux Arts Gallery, London, in 1956.\n\nThe subjects and intentions of Auerbach’s paintings remained consistent. When he moved to his studio in Camden Town in 1954, he began recording such locations as Primrose Hill, which was close enough to observe and draw each morning before returning to paint indoors. For his portraits he always found it most challenging to take as his subject a person he knew well. At first he laid brushstrokes on top of one another, whereas from the late 1960s he scraped down the impasto after each session; as a final step he allowed the relatively soft paint to form spontaneously a geography of peaks, channels and merged colours, corresponding to facts and feelings about the subject. \n\nAfter returning to large portrait drawings in charcoal in the mid-1970s, Auerbach found a way of simulating living, solid subjects and translucent spaces by drawing in oil. The inventive conjunctions of mixed neutral tones and decisive primary marks became more plastic and resonant than before, and more responsive to random incidents. Articulate about his own art and his responses to other painters, Auerbach claimed to work from inside his pictures. He stated: “My motives are among the most common: the wish to retrieve a shameful life by making something and the wish to defeat the passing of time by preserving an experience.

He then committed himself to painting and famously destroyed most of his early work.\n\nThroughout his career Bacon drew upon an eclectic mixture of sources ranging from Rembrandt van Rijn to Diego Velázquez, the latter inspiring his Screaming Pope series of the early 1950s. He was also influenced by the time-lapse photography of Eadweard Muybridge and the films of Sergei Eisenstein, illustrated medical textbooks and newspapers. His highly original style incorporates elements of Surrealism and Expressionism and his deformed naked figures and anguished heads are usually contained within a characteristic scaffolding or inner frame. Bacon was a noted portraitist who preferred to work from photographs although his subjects were usually intimate friends. Aiming not for a likeness but an equivalent, his portraits, like that of Isabel Rawsthorne, are painfully distorted, powerful, and disturbing visions of life and death.\n\nDuring the 1950s Bacon’s reputation spread internationally and he was generally considered the greatest of modern British painters, unflinchingly revealing the essential loneliness and vulnerability of the human condition. Bacon’s close friend George Dyer was one of his most frequent subjects from the mid-1960s; after Dyer’s death on the eve of Bacon’s retrospective in Paris in 1971, he painted a number of pictures in his memory. Bacon never lost his capacity to surprise nor his willingness to risk failure. His taste for strangeness remains firmly in evidence even in a late work such as Study of the Human Body (1982; Paris, Pompidou), in which a grotesquely truncated male torso, nude except for the cricket pads covering its legs, elicits from the viewer the shock of recognition of the human form reassembled as if being invented for the first time.','Ireland','Francis','Bacon',1909,1992,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_bacon',1),(13,'Dutch landscape and genre painter. Karel Beschey continued the tradition of Jan Brueghel the Elder in Antwerp where he was born in 1706. The family was particularly influential as his brother Balthasar (1708-76) was also an art dealer and, from 1754, Director of the Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp, which numbered five Bescheys among its members, including his other brothers Jacob Andries (1710-86) and Jan Frans (1717-99).\n\nKarel Beschey studied with the genre and allegorical painter Hendrick Govaerts (1669-1720), who had settled in Antwerp in 1699. Like his brother Balthasar, Karel specialised in small-scale landscapes on panel in the tradition of Brueghel. Beschey painted with delicate impasto, creating atmospheric blue-green distances and foregrounds enlivened with figures picked out in touches of clear red and blue. Village scenes and sets of landscapes representing the four seasons are favourite themes. \n\nWinter Landscape (shown here) is especially complex in composition and delicately painted. The miniaturist technique derives from Brueghel, while aspects of the painting – such as the trees dividing the composition – can also be found in the work of Jan’s elder brother, Pieter Brueghel the Younger (1564/5-1637/8). This landscape tradition descends directly from the superbly innovative landscapes of Pieter Breughel the Elder (circa 1525/30-69). Such was the prestige of this Flemish tradition that there was a ready market for paintings made in homage to the Brueghels well into the 18th century.\n\nThe beautifully observed figures in Beschey’s painting wear 17th-century dress. He depicts the pleasures and duties of winter: skaters, kolf players, wood gatherers, travellers in a heavy, covered wagon. White, grey and pale blue evoke the chill of the landscape. The delicate hues of the clothes – lilac, pea green, dusky pink, subtle ochres – make the foreground sparkle and lead the eye into the landscape. Boats are frozen into the ice, the windmill stilled. This delightful evocation of winter is a fresh and lively continuation of the Brueghel tradition.','Holland','Karel','Beschey',1706,1776,1,'',1),(14,'Danish painter. Ola Billgren was born in Copenhagen in January, 1940. His parents, Hans Billgren and Grete Lützhöft-Billgren, were both painters so he was largely trained at home. At the age of 13 he began to exhibit watercolours and ink drawings locally in Österlen in Skåne, Sweden where the family had moved in 1940. A trip to Spain in 1958 had a decisive impact on his later production. Having settled in Lund in 1960, he participated in a number of group shows where he demonstrated a lyrical, abstract painting style.\n\nEarly in 1963 he deserted the abstract and embarked on a photorealist course. His breakthrough followed shortly after with an exhibition at Galleri Karlsson in Stockholm in 1966. During the 1970s, Billgren’s work gradually evolved towards Colourism with overtones of Romantic painting. Two exhibitions at Galleri Engström in Stockholm in 1982 and 1983 testify to the result of this process, in which collage, among other art forms, plays an important role. In addition to painting, Billgren has devoted considerable time to graphics, collage and watercolours. (He increasingly worked with pure photography and he produced a short film, Ill Wind). He has also designed the sets for plays by Samuel Beckett and Marguerite Duras at Malmö Stadsteater.\n\nBillgren began contributing to art magazines and newspapers in the 1960s and has been associated with the cultural pages of the Sydsvenska Dagbladet for several years.

Ivan Black was born in London in 1972 and studied at Middlesex University. His interest in sculpture began at an early age and motion quickly became central to his work, adding, as he saw it, another dimension of complexity and interest to his experiments. An inherent problem solver, he spent his early years amassing multi-disciplinary skills in pursuit of realising his ambitious ideas.\n\nBlack’s current work uses his unique methodology to create kinetic forms that mutate upon the introduction of energy. The repetition of identical elements is a recurrent theme in his work; by this means he builds complex, fluid structures. Each sculpture is a section of a potentially continuous sequence, generated in form by the application of systematic rules to his geometry.\n\nTaking inspiration for his designs from iconic natural geometry (e.g. the DNA helix; movement of celestial bodies through space; sound and light waves), and combining these with mathematical concepts and the pioneering spirit of the British engineer, Black creates a synergy between art, science and technology. His meticulously engineered and seamlessly integrated mechanisms are central to the behaviour and appeal of his work. Tending towards the Minimalist in design, the movement is allowed to take centre stage.\n\nBlack’s work has been exhibited in galleries worldwide, including the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice, The Cass Sculpture Foundation, Goodwood, West Sussex, Flowers Gallery, London, Interart Sculpture Park, The Netherlands, Palmyra Sculpture Centre, Mallorca and the Hannah Peschar Sculpture Garden, Surrey. Black is a regular exhibitor at the Kinetica Art Fair and his work is included in several significant private collections.','Engalnd','Ivan','Black',1972,-1,1,'',1),(16,'English painter, printmaker and sculptor. While still a student Blake began producing paintings that openly testified to his love of popular entertainment and the ephemera of modern life. Blake displayed his nostalgia for dying traditions not only through his preference for circus imagery, but also by artificially weathering the irregular wooden panels on which he was then painting. His respect for fairground art, barge painting, tattooing, commercial art, illustration and other forms of image-making rooted in folkloric traditions led him to produce some of the first works to which the term Pop Art was later applied.\n\nFrom the late 1950s, however, he also produced works far more radical in conception by eliminating the personal touch. Fine Art Bit (1959; London, Tate), Got a Girl (1960-1; University of Manchester, Whitworth Art Gallery) and Toy Shop (1962; London, Tate) typify the collage paintings and constructions composed only of patterns of bright colour and of ready-made materials such as postcards, photographs, book illustrations, toys and other objects, and brutally presented without mediation. The acts of selection and retrieval in these works, generally made in alliance with references to pop music and mass entertainment, including Hollywood films, wrestling, pin-ups and strip-tease, are presented as equivalent to the painstaking recording of observations. He would use imagery, like that of Marilyn Monroe, which would later become the hallmarks of American Pop Art. To the general public, however, he remains best known as the designer of the record cover for Sgt. Pepper’sLonely Hearts Club Band bythe Beatles(1967), a fitting tribute to his genuine enthusiasm for the popular icons of his time.','Engalnd','Peter','Blake',1932,-1,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Blake_(artist)',1),(17,'Italian painter and printmaker.Boldini received his earliest training from his father, the painter Antonio Boldini (1799-1872). At 18 he was already known in Ferrara as an accomplished portrait painter.Travelling to Florence in 1862, he attended the Scuola del Nudo at the Accademia di Belle Arti and frequented the Caffè Michelangelo, a meeting-place of progressive artists, where he came into contact with the Macchiaoli group of artists.\n\nBetween 1866 and 1868 Boldini enjoyed the patronage and the hospitality of Isabella and Walter Falconer, members of the expatriate English community living in Florence. Boldini decorated a room at their villa, La Falconiera, near Pistoia, with the only mural paintings of his career, first displaying the grand manner and dynamism that was to become characteristic of his art.In 1870 and 1871 Boldini travelled to London as a guest of William Cornwallis-West, a friend of the Falconers. He was inspired by the great 18thcentury English portrait painters and was also impressed with Joseph Mallord William Turner’s work.\n\nSettling in Paris in 1871, Boldini soon became a celebrated artist, signing a contract with the art dealer Adolphe Goupil to paint landscapes and genre subjects that met the market’s demand for small, bright, lightly executed, 18thcentury costume pieces.Also popular were his views of Parisian life.In 1876 he travelled to Germany, where he met Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel, and to The Netherlands, where he admired the work of Frans Hals. Around this time Boldini began to paint portraits of beautiful society women, peculiar to which is the contrast between their carefully rendered and illuminated faces and the loosely painted, undefined surroundings.Boldini also found an affinity with Édouard Manet and established an enduring friendship with Edgar Degas.\n\nIn 1889 Boldini travelled with Degas to Spain, where they admired the work of Velázquez, and then to Morocco.In 1890, at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, he was inspired by the grand manner of Anders Zorn’s portraits. While continuing to paint still lifes, views of Venice, horses and portraits of women, often in provocative poses, Boldini specialised in portraits of the beautiful and the famous.By the end of the century, he was, along with John Singer Sargent, the most sought-after portrait painter in Paris.','Italy','Giovanni','Boldini',1842,1931,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Boldini',1),(18,'Italian painter. Arturo Bonfanti was born in 1905 in Bergamo, northern Italy, and studied at the city’s Andrea Fontani art school. In 1926 he moved to Milan, the hub of Italy’s avant-garde. Initially he worked as a designer and graphic artist for publishers, only painting in a figurative style in his spare time. Bonfanti’s first exhibition, at Galleria Permanente in Bergamo in 1927, showed the influence of his compatriot Giorgio Morandi, but his works were not to be exhibited regularly again until the 1950s. \n\nIn 1952 he was awarded the Prix du Film des Marionnettes at the VIII Festival of Amateurs, Cannes, where he showed works connected to motion and cinematography. But it was his post-war trips to Paris, where he met Alberto Magnelli, Hans Arp and Gérard Schnieder, and to the UK, where he met Victor Pasmore and Ben Nicholson, which had a profound effect on his style. From the 1950s onwards Bonfanti became a proponent of Concrete art, rejecting object and figure in favour of a more purist colour, line and form. Often referred to as having ‘poetic geometry’, his individual abstraction embraces a soft line and subtle colour combinations, as can be seen in this 1961 oil, Composizione A. 8.\n\nBy the late 1950s, Arturo Bonfanti’s work had become more acclaimed, and in 1959 he exhibited for the first of many times with the esteemed Galeria Lonrenzelli, Bergamo. In 1962 he also showed with the celebrated Galerie Denise René, Paris; however, it was an entire room devoted exclusively to Bonfanti’s work during the 1968 Venice Biennale which formed a pivotal point in the artist’s career. This is the year he painted V.392. A year later, he participated in the São Paolo Biennal. \n\nDuring the mid-1960s Bonfanti started his series of white wood reliefs and sculpture, thereby expanding his output into the third dimension.','Italy','Arturo','Bonfanti',1905,1978,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_Bonfanti',1),(19,'French painter and printmaker. From the 1860s onwards, the art of Japanese woodblock printing, Uyiko-e, provided a source of inspiration to many of the Impressionist painters in Europe, giving rise to Japonisme. This coincided with a renewed interest in the art of printmaking. Surprisingly, the medium where this Japanese influence was most in evidence in the West was in lithography, not in woodcuts, and in printmaking the democratically minded Pierre Bonnard found that he could share the same image many times. The Japanese prints feature large expanses of colour and little attention was given to perspective or shadows; often figures in them were depicted as silhouettes, represented by these flat plains. Bonnard was also on the periphery of the Nabis movement, a group of artists who were both representational and decorative in their approach. They were on the one hand strongly influenced by the work of Paul Gauguin and on the other by the Impressionists. Much of Bonnard’s work, especially in his printmaking, was like that of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s, strongly affected by Art Nouveau.\n\nLa Petite Blanchisseuse depicts one of the thousands of Parisian women and girls employed by the laundry industry at that time, going about their daily business, just as the traditional Japanese prints had often featured solitary women carrying out mundane tasks. Like much of the work produced by the Nabis artists, it is painterly and non-realistic. Bonnard’s treatment of the figure is very flat, with little shadow, and the scene is whimsical, as can be seen in her posture, and especially in his addition of the dog. The artist has composed the work considering the medium carefully, and exploited the qualities of lithography. The colours used by the artist here are largely dull, reflecting the drab, industrial Paris of the time, but there are flashes of vibrancy in the red dog and the door, displaying Bonnard’s sense of the power of colour. It would be later that he would develop a brighter palette when he moved to the south of France in 1912. La Petite Blanchisseuse is part of a portfolio of 22 prints by various leading artists, published by the renowned Ambroise Vollard, entitled L’Album des Peintres-Graveurs.

Born in 1891, Gustav Gideon Börje studied at Stockholm’s Technical School (later known as the College of Arts), but then only continued his artistic studies in life drawing via evening classes. It took fellow artist and compatriot Eric Hallström to convince Börje to take up painting as a career. They set up a joint studio on Kungsholmen, Lake Mälaren, and, by 1918, the two artists were showing at the Strandvägen art gallery of Arturo Ciacellis, a respected Italian Futurist, art dealer and Stockholm resident. Following many Swedish artists, Börje travelled to Italy after World War I and spent some time in the south of France as an Esther Lindahl Scholar. \n\nBörje started out as a naïvist, but during his stay in Italy he became influenced by early Italian art, adopting a refreshingly clear design and classical symmetry to his compositions, as can be seen in Village scene with fountain. \n\nDuring the 1930s much of Börje’s oeuvre was focused on Sweden’s northern landscapes. In 1932 he became a founding member of Färg och Form, the primitive colourist group which included, among others, Bror Hjorth and Sven Erixson. At this time he painted several portraits of friends and colleagues. \n\nBörje’s work can be seen in the National Museum, Stockholm, the Museum of Modern Art, Stockholm, Gothenburg Art Museum, Malmö Museum, Waldermarsudde and Stockholm City Museum.','Sweden','Gideon','Börje',1891,1965,1,'',1),(21,'Colombian sculptor and painter. As a youth in Medellín, Fernando Botero briefly attended a school for matadors, but soon took up painting, having been inspired by the pre-Columbian and Spanish colonial art that surrounded him, as well as by the political work of Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. His own works were first exhibited in 1948, and two years later he had his first one-man showin Bogotá. While studying painting in Madrid in the early 1950s, he made his living by copying paintings housed in the Prado Museum – particularly those of his idols at the time, Francisco de Goya and Diego Velázquez – and selling them to tourists. He spent much of the rest of the decade studying the art treasures of Paris and Florence.\n\nThroughout the 1950s Botero began experimenting with proportion and size. When he moved to New York City in 1960, he had developed his trademark style: the depiction of round, corpulent humans and animals. In these works he referenced Latin American folk art in his use of flat, bright colour and boldly outlined forms. The inflated proportions of his figures also suggest an element of political satire, perhaps hinting at the subjects’ overblown sense of their own importance. His other paintings from the period include bordello scenes and nudes, which possess comic qualities that challenge and satirise sexual mores, and portraits of families, which possess a gentle, affectionate quality.','Columbia','Fernando','Botero',1932,-1,2,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Botero',1),(22,'In 1973 Botero returned to Paris and began creating sculptures in addition to his works on canvas. These often monumental bronze works extended the concerns of his painting, depicting huge animals (including bulls), human torsos, reclining women, and massive objects, including a gigantic coffee pot. His sculpture was exhibited at the Paris Art Fair in 1977, the year he also began to paint again. His work continued to be shown in galleries worldwide. In 1983 he established a workshop in an area of Tuscany renowned for its metalwork, which allowed him to spend several months each year creating his increasingly large sculptures. He also revisited bullfighting as subject matter for his painting, aspiring to become the definitive artist on the subject.\n\nIn 2005 Botero gained considerable attention for his Abu Ghraib series, which was exhibited first in Europe. He based the works on reports of United States forces’ abuses of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison during the Iraq War. Beginning with an idea he had on a plane journey, Botero produced more than 85 paintings and 100 drawings exploring this concept and ‘painting out the poison’.

Eugene Boudin was born in Honfleur in 1824. As the son of a mariner, he became familiar with the moods and atmosphere of the sea, particularly the passing of the wind-blown cloud and water. After a year of schooling in Le Havre in 1835, Boudin worked with a stationer and framer who displayed paintings by visiting artists, through which he became acquainted with Théodule Ribot, Thomas Couture and Jean-François Millet, as well as Constant Troyon and Eugène Isabey, who were important influences. In 1847 he decided to become a professional painter and went to Paris, where he was stimulated by the landscapes, marine paintings and still lifes of the 17th-century Dutch school and contemporary Barbizon paintings.\n\nBoudin was one the first French landscape painters to paint outside, directly from nature, and his numerous beach and harbour scenes form a direct link between the carefully observed Naturalism of the early 19th century and the brilliant light and fluid brushwork of late 19th-century Impressionism. His figure subjects range from studies of peasants at their festivities or devotions to marketing scenes and washerwomen; however, his most famous sequence is his depictions of beach scenes (1860-94), prompted by Isabey, showing the bourgeoisie and aristocracy at recreation on the sands of Deauville and Trouville (from where this port scene derives).\n\nWhile Boudin never pushed as far as the Impressionists in the visual analysis and optical blend of colour divisions or in their short, stabbing brushstrokes, he was arguably one of their greatest influences. For example, Boudin met Claude Monet in 1858 and took him on as his unofficial pupil, offering the younger artist substantial encouragement, stressing particularly the primacy of working directly from nature.\n\nIn 1859 Boudin’s Pardon of Ste-Anne-la-Palud was accepted at the Paris Salon. Around 1861 he encountered Camille Corot and Charles-François Daubigny, the former appropriately designating him ‘Le Roi des Cieux’ (‘The King of The Skies’). He was represented in the First Impressionist Exhibition of 1874 and in 1881 signed a contract with dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, with resulting American sales.\n\nFrom 1892 to 1895 Boudin regularly visited Venice and depicted traditional views with a cool, resonant luminosity. This view of the French cod fishing port, which was until 1204 the residence of the Dukes of Normandy, also hails from this period of Boudin’s output. In 1892 he was awarded the Ordre National de la Légion d’Honneur, a somewhat tardy recognition of his talents and influence on the art of his contemporaries.','France','Eugène','Boudin',1824,1898,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Boudin',1),(24,'Flemishpainter, draughtsman and etcher. Born in Brussels and trained as a painter Pieter Bout is best known for his landscapes while beach scenes such as this example are extremely rare. His paintings have an easy and lively character, and yet he used the brush with precision. Scheveningen, originally a fishing village on the northern Dutch coast near The Hague, was immortalised in paint by many artists, including Simon De Vlieger (National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London) and more famously,Joseph Mallord William Turner (Tate, London). In the painting shown here, Bout depicts a fine sunny day, the beach teeming with activity as fishermen and women set out their catch, and customers inspect their wares. The intense interest the protagonists display in the catch underscores the economic importance of fishing to the survival of Dutch communities, and the present painting is an illustration of this aspect of national prosperity. The resilience of fishing villages like Scheveningen and its inhabitants, all of whom identified with the sea and with the topography of the Dutch coastline, were a source of tremendous national pride. A Fish Market on the Seashore resides in the collection of the Staatliche Kunsthalle, Karlsruhe, Germany dated 1683, while an etching of another composition representing the beach at Scheveningen by Bout is at the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco.','Finland','Pieter','Bout',1658,1719,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Bout',1),(25,'French painter, printmaker and sculptor. Born in Argenteuil into a family of painters and decorators, Georges Braque was himself for three years an apprenticed house painter, learning techniques including combing, graining, and marbling, all of which he employed with wit and affection throughout his career. Braque became a full-time artist in 1904, and between 1906 and 1914 he was at first connected with Fauvism and then, more importantly, with Cubism, which Picasso and he developed ‘as if we were two climbers roped together’. Braque contributed several of the motifs and stylistic devices of Cubism, namely musical instruments or references (which can be seen in this etching paying homage to Bach), stencilled numbers and letters on the surface, foreign matter in the paint-mix (sand, ashes, tobacco), and trompe l’oeil effects. Indeed, the first Papier collé (pasted paper work) was made by Braque in 1911.\n\nCalled to the war in 1914, Braque served with gallantry, suffering a severe head wound in 1915. After field-hospital trepanning, he recovered but was discharged, with the Croix de Guerre and the Légion d’Honneur, in 1916. He emerged from convalescence to paint again, briefly taking up where he had left off, but now developed an individual, personal style in which subtlety of composition, richness of colour, and variety of handling marked him as a modern master. He went on to develop and diversify his Cubist beginnings in later life, as can be seen in this lithograph from 1960, which reflects the colourful freedom of Henri Matisse as much as it recalls the earlier table scenes by Pablo Picasso and himself. Braque, a brilliant decorative artist, also had a lifelong interest in ancient Greek and Etruscan art, and in the 1920s he painted Cenaphorae, large, semi-draped female figures carrying baskets of fruit, and began a series of Greek heroes, nymphs, and gods engraved into plaster through black-painted surfaces. For Ambroise Vollard he illustrated Hesiod’s Theogony with 16 etchings. Also at this time, around 1931, he built a house at Varengeville, Normandy, and summered there, painting coastal scenes.\n\nBraque’s great achievement is revealed, however, in the still lifes on pedestal tables (guéridons), the interiors with figures, the billiard tables, and the studios. In his final phase, a great bird enters his work as it does in this example of a late, monochromatic etching (he decorated a ceiling in the Etruscan Gallery of the Louvre with birds in 1952-3), bringing emphasis to his space/form devices and lending them a haunting, visionary aura.Braque was revered by all who knew him for his personal grace and nobility, his intellectual honesty and exquisite taste, qualities which are evident in his work and which, allied to masterly craftsmanship, make him one of the greatest painters of the 20th century.

When the Bugatti family moved to Paris around 1904, Rembrandt met the businessman, gallerist and foundry owner Adrien Hébrard, who was responsible for casting many of his sculptures. After gaining his initial exposure as an artist at the Venice Biennale and then winning the Grand Prix for sculpture in Milan in 1906,Bugatti moved to Antwerp in 1907,where the city zoo provided him with a studio in which to make his animal sculptures.

In 1874 Gustave Caillebotte was invited to take part in the First Impressionist Exhibition in the Nadar Gallery in Paris by Edgar Degas, who he had met at the house of their mutual friend Giuseppe de Nittis. Instead, Caillebotte made his debut in the Second Impressionist exhibition at Auguste Renoir’s initiation in 1876, showing eight paintings, including Floor-scrapers of 1875, his earliest masterpiece, now in the Musée d’Orsay, Paris. Caillebotte organised the Impressionist show of 1877 and made great efforts to restore cohesion to the group by persuading Claude Monet to exhibit in 1879. Having inherited a large fortune from his parents, Caillebotte gave assistance to his artist friends by purchasing their work and amassing a famous collection of Impressionist masterpieces that he left to the state. Although the bequest was only partially accepted on his death in 1894, it provoked numerous and violent protests but now forms the core of the collection at the Musée d’ Orsay.\n\nCaillebotte’s style is often said to belong to the school of Realism but it was strongly influenced by his Impressionist associates. Although the exact location of this picture is unknown, it is possible that Temps de Neige depicts a suburb such as Pontoise, Louveciennes or Argenteuil, all of which provided much inspiration for the snow scenes of Monet, Caillebotte, Camille Pissarro and Alfred Sisley at that time. Caillebotte used a high viewpoint, and the near-monochromatic tonality lends to the overall sense of isolation. This type of composition originated with the development of photography. Its design is influenced by the cropped photographic images which were popular among the Impressionists at the time. Disillusioned by disagreements that resulted in the breakup of the Impressionist group, Caillebotte took little part in Parisian artistic life after 1882. He settled in Petit-Gennevilliers near Argenteuil where, like Monet, he lavished much care on his garden, using it as a source for his later works.','France','Gustave','Caillebotte',1848,1894,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Caillebotte',1),(29,'American sculptor, painter, illustrator, printmaker and designer.Calder graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey, with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1919. In 1923 he enrolled at the Art Students League in New York to produce oil paintings and in 1924 he became a freelance artist for the National Police Gazette,sketching sporting events and circus performances. In 1926, his first illustrated book, Animal Sketching was published, based on studies made at the Bronx and Central Park Zoos in New York.\n\nLater that year, Calder travelled to Paris, attending sketching classes at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. He was particularly influenced by the inventive collages of Joan Miró and by the mystical art of Paul Klee. In Paris, Calder made wood and wire animals with movable parts and designed the first pieces of his miniature Circus (1926-32; New York). Performances of this hand-operated circus helped to introduce Calder to the Parisian avant-garde and to potential patrons. From 1927-30 he constructed figures, animals and portrait heads in wire and carved similar subjects in wood. After visiting Piet Mondrian’s studio in 1930, Calder began to experiment with abstract constructions; invited to join Abstraction-Création in 1931, he was one of the few Americans to be actively involved in the group. In 1931 he exhibited his first non-objective construction, and in the following year he showed hand-cranked and motorised mobiles, marking the beginning of his development as a leading exponent of kinetic art. After an initial involvement with geometric elements and machine imagery, he introduced biomorphic forms into his kinetic sculptures. Both the painted constructions and the brightly coloured mobiles synthesised Constructivist methods and materials with abstract forms derived from Surrealist imagery.\n\nHe refined his wind-driven mobiles to produce elegant, space-encompassing abstractions of gracefully bending wires. During the 1960s and 1970s colossal stabiles were commissioned for public sites around the world, Calder’s arching forms, dynamic surfaces and biomorphic imagery complementing the geometric regularity and severity of modern architecture. In his mature years his production included paintings, drawings, prints, book illustrations, jewellery and tapestries, all of which were composed of bold, abstract elements and in primary colours. Shortly before his death, Calder completed a colossal stabile, La Défense, at the Rond Point de La Défense métro station in Paris.','America','Alexander','Calder',1898,1976,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Calder',1),(30,'Italian painter. Luca Cambiaso (or Cambiasi, Cangiagio), born in Genoa, was known for his remarkable artistic imagination and a bold sense of design. Four known paintings of the Baptism of Christ have survived, allfrom ecclesiastic commissions. The painting which relates most closely to the composition of the present sheet was made for the church of Sta Chiara in San Martino d’Albaro in Genoa, circa 1570. The composition relies on the balance between the two main figures, whose actions and proportions are accentuated by geometric reduction of shapes, only the ink wash providing some concession to naturalism. The artist made relatively few preparatory drawings, focusing in on detailed studies of drapery, heads or limbs and modelletti, so any such occurrences are very rare.\n\nCambiaso started to develop his celebrated proto-Cubist, simplified anatomical drawings in the 1550s. Their function may have been no more than to speed up the design process for his compositions, much as Nicolas Poussin did nearly a century later, allowing him to explore the arrangement and balance of figures. The notion of reducing the human form to a series of geometric shapes had its origins in the German printed manuals of the early 16thcentury, such as that of Erhard Schön (circa 1491-1542), published in the 1530s. Cambiaso’s work was said by the contemporary art historian G.P. Lomazzo to belong to a specifically Lombard tradition, as opposed to the more naturalistic Tuscan and Emilian schools of draughtsmanship. Collectively they reflect Cambiaso’s important role in the development of Baroque drawing.','Italy','Luca','Cambiaso',1527,1585,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Cambiaso',1),(31,'Italian painter, etcher and draughtsman. Giovanni Antonio Canal, or Canaletto (‘little Canal’) as he became known, was the most distinguished Italian veduti (view) painter of the 18th century. Although he spent most of his life painting in Italy, in 1746 he moved to London to be closer to his market among ‘Grand Tourists’ and he remained there until 1755. Canaletto’s fame rests above all on his Venetian output, on his panoramic, brilliantly day-lit scenes looking across Saint Mark’s Square or the Grand Canal. While some of these paintings were purely topographical, others include scenes derived from festivals or ceremonial events. He also painted purely imaginary views (capriccios), although the demarcation between the real and the invented is never clear-cut. Canaletto was highly successful with the English, helped in this by the British consul, Joseph Smith, whose own large collection of Canaletto’s works was sold to King George III in 1762. The British Royal Collection has the world’s largest group of his paintings and drawings.','Italy','Giovanni Antonio Canal,','called Canaletto',1697,1768,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaletto',1),(32,'Swedish painter and art critic. Born in St Petersburg in 1897, Otto G. Carlsund was the eldest son of engineer Anton Carlsund and Gabrielle Tardif. In 1908 his mother and the children moved to Sweden where, after a few years, Carlsund worked as a legislation officer and car salesman before studying painting at the Konstakademien in Oslo (1922-3). Under the direction of Ferdinand Léger he attended the Académie Moderne in Montparnasse in 1924. During his time in Paris (1924-30) he maintained friendships with Léger, but also, among others, Piet Mondrian and Amédée Ozenfant. At this time he was primarily interested in Cubism and geometric abstraction, influences reflected in The Chair (1926) currently held at Stockholm’s Moderna Museet and this example, Aktörerna, painted in the same year.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Swedish painter Gösta Adrian-Nilsson also became influential in Otto G. Carlsund’s development, notably with regard to his musical paintings, such as Komposition med musikinstrument. Through visual elements Carlsund tried to achieve an auditory effect; the contrapuntal music of Baroque composer J.S. Bach inspired him in this.\n\nIn 1929 Carlsund co-founded the pioneering Art Concret group in Paris with Theo van Doesburg, Jean Hélion, and the Armenian painter Leon Tutundjian, and in 1930 published their manifesto The Basis of Concrete Art in the first and only edition of Art Concret. The manifesto stated that, ‘The painting should be constructed entirely from purely plastic elements, that is to say planes and colours. A pictorial element has no other significance than itself and consequently the painting possesses no other significance than itself.’ Concrete art distinguished itself from abstract art in that it emanated directly from the imagination rather than from an abstraction of any form of nature. \nCarlsund experienced a creative crisis soon after the publication, preferring to write more and paint less. His radicalism continued through the written word, however: his art criticisms often met with opposition, although in later years they attracted greater interest. He published his own magazine, Konstvärlden, from 1941 to 1945.','Sweden','Otto G.','Carlsund',1897,1948,1,'',1),(33,'French sculptor. César came from a working-class environment and spent his childhood in Marseille, where he studied from 1935 to 1943 at the city’sÉcole des Beaux-Arts under a sculptor who had worked as a stonecutter for Auguste Rodin. In 1943, on gaining admission to the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he completed his studies in 1950, he settled permanently in the capital, discovering the work of sculptors such as Constantin Brancusi, Alberto Giacometti and Germaine Richier; he was also impressed by the iron sculpture of Pablo Gargallo. César’s first sculptures, made of plaster and iron and dating from 1947-48, were of an academic style but in materials that consciously rejected the classical tradition. These were followed by works made of repoussé lead and soldered wire. Guided by a concern for economy, César assembled disparate elements including waste lead, copper pipe and other industrial metal scrap soldered or welded together so as to retain their rough appearance. In the first such sculptures, for example The Fish (1953-54; Paris, Pompidou), the human figures or animals thus formed revealed their method of construction in a threadlike lattice. César’s first one-man exhibition, in 1954, displayed the development of an entire bestiary of insects and distorted winged figures.\n\nFrom around 1956, César began to use metal in a form that appeared fuller and more solid, as in The Devil (1956; Paris, Pompidou), or sometimes as flat sheets, for example in Flat Sculpture (1958; London, Tate). He continued working in this style until 1965, favouring abstract reliefs but also concentrating on the human figure, as in the portrait of the writer Patrick Waldberg (1961-2; London, Tate), or combining the two in such a way as to reveal a clear debt to Classical sculpture in spite of his use of industrial materials, for example in The Other One’s Sister (1962; Otterlo, Kröller-Müller). By this stage César had a substantial international reputation, and he represented France at both the Venice Biennale (1956) and the São Paulo Biennal (1957). At the Salon de Mai in Paris in 1960,César created a scandal by exhibiting three large metal blocks made from compressed industrial scrap, mainly from cars, includingAutomobile Compression (1960; Geneva, Musée d’Art et d’Histoire). These ‘compressions’, as he called these sculptures ready-made from recycled materials, seemed the product of a destructive act, disrespectful of tradition, but they made possible the creation of new forms. The most spectacular new development in his work, however, concerned the Expansions, initiated in 1967 using polyurethane foam, whose elasticity and flexibility enabled him to conceive forms with undulating movements. The first of these was produced as a public performance, with the solidified material cut into pieces and distributed to the audience.','France','César','Baldaccini',1921,1998,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Baldaccini',1),(34,'British sculptor. Chadwick worked as a draughtsman for various architectural firms in London from 1933 to 1939. During World War II he was a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm, but continued his architectural work from 1944 to 1946. In 1946 he began experimenting with sculpture, his first works being mobiles. These were generally based on insect and bird forms. Chadwick’s mobiles were exhibited at his first one-man show at the Gimpel Fils gallery in London in 1950 and this was followed by a commission to produce two sculptures for the Festival of Britain in 1951. Having then found his vocation as a sculptor,Chadwick - attended a welding school in 1950 to enable him to tackle large-scale works.\n\nAfter about six years of producing mobiles Chadwick began to make open, welded constructions, sometimes incorporating glass. In 1953 he moved on to produce solid sculptures, creating works of a highly abstracted human form, executed in a novel technique. One of the first of these was Conjunction (1953; London, Tate), made from an iron rod cage filled with a material called Stolit, an artificial stone. Like most of Chadwick’s figure works up to about 1970 the work disturbs the viewer through its skeletal, distorted form.\n\nIn addition to the human form, Chadwick made a number of sculptures of aggressive, angular creatures, such as Idiomorphic Beast (1953; Bristol, Museum and Art Gallery). In 1956 he won the International Sculpture Prize at the Venice Biennale, which firmly established his reputation. From 1959 to 1962 he created a series of Watcher works: standing abstracted figures which stare in a blank, menacing manner at the viewer. In 1962 the sculptor was invited, together with Alexander Calder and David Smith, to execute works at the Italsider steel works for an exhibition at Spoleto in Italy, and there he first worked with welded sheet steel. \n\nAfter the 1970s Chadwick’s sculptures lost their previous anguished, aggressive aspect. Concentrating almost wholly on the human figure he produced works that were softer in form and often embodied movement.He also produced several paired figures, invariably following the gender convention that the female had a triangular face and the male a rectangular one. In the late 1980s he began experimenting with sculptures constructed from sheet stainless steel. Enjoying particular success in the 1950s, Chadwick was one of the groups of sculptors seen as continuing the prestigious reputation of British sculpture established by Henry Moore. Chadwick himself has been described as Moore’s logical successor.

George Clausen was born in London toa Scottish mother and Danish father. He originally followed his father’s employment as an interior decorator but in 1867 began to attend evening classes at the Royal College of Art. His tutor was Edwin Long who convinced the young painter to pursue art as a full-time career. In 1875 Clausen made a trip to Holland and Belgium where he became influenced by Dutch Naturalism at the Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp. After studying briefly under Professor Joseph Van Lerius (1823-76), he began to sketch in the fishing villages along the Dutch coast; the product of these studies, High Mass at a Fishing Village on the Zuyder Zee (1876; Nottingham, Castle Museum), was his first exhibit at the Belgian Royal Academy and was well received. In 1881 he married Agnes Webster and the couple settled in Berkshire. In 1882 Clausen left for France where he studied briefly at the Academie Julien in Paris. William Adolphe Bouguereau, the great French Salon artist, was his first tutor but Clausen soon became fascinated by the art of Jules Bastien Lepage, the Ruralist and plein-air painter. Closely identifying with English rural life, Clausen favoured Naturalism during this period as a technique of what he called ‘studied impartiality’, with its emphasis on literal representation rather than narrative content.\n\nOn returning to England,Clausen became a founder member of the New English Art Club (NEAC) and was the most widely respected of the NEAC painters, promoting the interests of the Glasgow Boys when they made their London debut at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1890. His works produced after 1891 demonstrate a greater interest in movement and atmosphere and echo Thomas Hardy in their presentation of the elemental qualities of English rural life. Clausen was widely regarded as the most popular professor at the Royal Academy of Arts in London since Joshua Reynolds and he was appointed an official war artist. The success of his war commission led to several invitations to paint murals, and upon completion of these projects he was knighted in 1927.','England','George','Clausen',1852,1944,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clausen',1),(37,'Englishpainter, draughtsman and printmaker. Prunella Clough attended the Chelsea School of Art in London (1938-9), but when her studies were interrupted by World War II she became an engineer’s draughtsman and mapper (1940-5). Her early work is characterised by the proletarian subject matter of labour and the urban landscape described within a narrow tonal range. Towards the end of her life she became regarded largely as an abstractionist, but her work always retained a figurative base, as if form had been filtered through memory.\n\nDuring the 1950s she introduced plant motifs into her urban scenes as well as winches, cooling towers and gasometers, all of which combine in abstracted compositions such as the current Urban Landscape V, which was illustrated on the front cover of her Whitechapel exhibition in 1960. In the late 1960s,Clough’s style became even freer in terms of colour and scale, but it still revealed her continuing fascination with the ‘edginess’ of form, the sudden intrusion of hard shapes into softer areas. From 1946 to 1951 Clough produced etchings, lithographs and paintings of fishermen and dockers in London, East Anglia and the industrial Midlands. Lowestoft Harbour (1951; London, Arts Council England Collection), included in the Festival of Britain’s 60 Paintings for ’51 exhibition, shows figures depicted in a style derived from Cubism and displays Clough’s primary and lasting preoccupation with the potential for abstraction in flatness of form. Inside and Out (1970-5; London, Arts Council England Collection) demonstrates how Clough’s work plays between abstraction and figuration, with its leafy shapes contained within the suggestion of a garden fence. Later pictures such as Samples (1997; London, Arts Council England Collection) describe colourful objects in shallow space with playful tonal gradations that suggest movement.

Jean Cocteau was orn in Maisons-Laffitte, Yvelines, a village near Paris, in 1889, to a socially prominent family. He was largely self-taught, and a natural explorer of several artistic mediums. Although his imaginative poetry, films and experimental theatre gained him the greatest accolades, Cocteau’s work as a draughtsman and painter with its free, elegant style, was an important element in conceiving him as a catalyst for the cross-fertilisation of art forms. And between the wars this is what Paris, where Cocteau resided, made its name for.\nCocteau first gained notice as a poet in his twenties, with the publication of Le Prince frivole (1910). This was the year he met choreographer Serge Diaghilev, the Ballets Russes, Nijinsky and Stravinsky. After being commissioned by Diaghilev for poster designs, Cocteau was soon promoted. By 1912 he had written the storyline for his first ballet, Le Dieu bleu, staged by Diaghilev. The Diaghilev collaboration continued unabated with one of Cocteau’s most acclaimed theatre pieces theatre, Parade (1917). This avant-garde fusion of the arts involved a dream team comprising music by Erik Satie, sets/costumes by Pablo Picasso and choreography by Léonide Massine. Successful theatrical partnerships carried on, including Le Boeuf sur le toit (1920) and Les Mariés de la tour Eiffel (1921), as well as a libretto for Stravinsky’s opera Oedipus Rex (1927). \n\nCocteau’s work as a draughtsman was widely established through Le Coq et l’Arlequin (1918), an essay accompanied by line drawings that revealed his idiosyncratic approach to illustration. His love of opium during the 1920s didn’t affect the volume of his output, but rather induced a dream-like state of mind, as is evident in his book Opium (1930) containing 40 drawings and three collages, and in his 1926 exhibition of ‘plastic poetry’ (drawings, objects and collages). Cocteau’s unique form of outline drawing (some say rivalling Picasso in its elegant simplicity and vitality of line) continued in books including Soixante dessins pour ‘Les Enfants terribles’ (1935), and remained largely unchanged for the rest of his life.\n\nIt was his films which earned Cocteau the greatest regard visually. He made his first, Le Sang d’un poète, in 1930, with La Belle et la bête (1945), Orphée (1950) and Testament d’Orphée (1960) being the most successful others. In the late 1940s he transferred some of his late Cubist drawings to tapestries and produced sculptures and several capricious ceramics in the 1950s. Latterly he designed a series of decorative interiors for churches, culminating with murals and windows for the Chapel of Notre-Dame de Jérusalem at Fréjus completed in 1963, the year of his death.','England','Jean','Cocteau',1889,1963,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cocteau',1),(39,'American photographer.

In 1982 he foundeda legendary photography course at Glasgow School of Art, which was the only full-time fine art photography department in Europe at the time.\n\nCooper’s own work explores the area between habitation and wilderness, at the edge of civilisation (this may have something to do with his early experience as a lumberjack).

I walked eight miles up... See Canyon in central California, got to its end, found and made a picture; which I consider my first real picture.’ Yet, his photographs are not documents, records of a voyage; he does not take his pictures, but ‘finds’ them.

He attended the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1930 to 1934, where he entered the intaglio engraving studio of Dezarrois. He qualified as a teacher in 1933, and in 1935 settled in Rennes where he became Professor of Art at the Lycée.

He returned to Paris in 1945 again becoming Professor of Art, this time at the Lycée Lakanal in Sceaux (1945-61). \nAs a painter, etcher and engraver, Couy represented nature from his imagination or childhood memories with a poetically charged simplicity. His works illustrated the succession of days and nights or seasons. In the 1950s he still depicted reality, but began to introduce elements of the abstraction, giving his work a new freedom and dream-like quality which transformed it beyond the natural.\nCouy took part in group exhibitions, including the Salon des Indépendants in Paris (1930-9), Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts and the Salon d’Automne (from 1935), as well as the Salon de la Jeune Gravure Contemporaine (from 1945).

Born in Liverpool, Tony Cragg studied sculpture at the Royal College of Art from 1973-7 and has since lived in Wuppertal, Germany. Cragg is one of the most acclaimed artists of the so-called New British Sculpture generation that emerged from London art schools in the late 1970s, and which included Anish Kapoor, Barry Flanagan, Richard Long and Bill Woodrow, among others. \n\nThe manipulation of materials into forms and images that offer new experiences and insights lies at the heart of Tony Cragg’s sculptural practice. His outlook is marked by an interest in analysing the relations between materials, science and the body. This scientific method of analysis is not mathematical but organic, based on the interaction between the material and the human body. Cragg’s oeuvre centres around two bodies of research: Early Forms and Rational Beings. Cragg described the Early Forms as ‘forms changing along an axis bilaterally curved with a simple profile’. These works explore the possibilities of distortion based on everyday objects such as vases or bottles. As the artist moves, the material is moved too, resulting in a sort of three-dimensional morphing. The sculptures belonging to the body of Rational Beings start from the outlines of a human gesture or profile. Their principal development is vertical, emphasising their origin as anthropomorphic, an aspect continued in the recent works shown here, the Zig Zag Bronzes, which appear to be three figures conversing, twisting and constantly moving.\n\nCragg was elected as a Royal Academician in 1994 and in 1988won the Turner Prize.

Nils von Dardel was born in Bettna, Södermanland, in 1888. After studying at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm, he was one of a group of young artists (including Sigrid Hjertén, Isaac Grünewald, Einar Jolin and Leander Engström) who went to Paris around 1910. He was influenced by the Post-Impressionists, the pure colours of the Fauvists and Japanese woodcuts. He also made some tentative attempts at Cubism using the subject of cityscapes.\nVon Dardel’s interest in Post-Impressionist tendencies, especially Pointillism, was expressed in strong, clear colours blended with a naïve style of storytelling. A typical example is Begravning i Senlis(Funeral in Senlis) from 1913, which he painted while staying in the small medieval town of Senlis. The human figure is the dominant motif in von Dardel’s works, noted,for example, in Den Döende Dandyn (The Dying Dandy) from 1918.\n\nIn 1913 von Dardel made friends with a fellow Swede, Rolf de Maré, who would later create the Ballets Suédois, which would perform in Paris in 1920-5. Von Dardel was not particularly well off, but he was imaginative and talented while de Maré was enthusiastic and had money. Together they were a very fruitful duo during the five eventful years of the dance company’s existence. In 1920 von Dardel produced the stage sets for the premiere piece Midsummer Wakeand for the pioneering dance drama Maison de Fous. The paintings from this period often recall stage sets; they are like sketches for a drama, or stills from a film in which the viewer assumes the role of author and director. Crime Passionnel (Crime of Passion) from 1921 is an example; vivid and even gory, while also echoing the artist’s hectic life in 1920s Paris. Von Darnel also collaborated with the subject of the painting shown here, Jacques Hébertot (1886-1970), a famous French theatre director, journalist and editor.\n\nVon Dardel led a self-destructive, itinerant and hectic life.

Trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, Edgar Degas was a pupil of Jean-Auguste-DominiqueIngres. He had a thorough academic education as an artist, reinforced by the copies of Old Master works that he made during a period of study in Italy (1856-9) and in the Louvre. His first independent works were history paintings, but Degas also painted many portraits. Early in the 1860s, he began to paint modern life genre scenes – initially of racecourses, and then, later in the decade, of theatre and ballet scenes. In many of these, he made a novel and ambitious combination of portraiture with genre painting, by showing recognisable figures in their habitual surroundings of work or leisure, for instance the members of the orchestra in L\'Orchestre de l\'Opéra (circa 1870; Paris, Musée d\'Orsay).\n\nDuring the 1870s he developed this idea further, notably in Portraits dans un Bureau (Nouvelle-Orléans) (1873; Pau, Musée des Beaux-Arts), an elaborate interior of a cotton office, painted during a visit to his uncle’s family in New Orleans. At the same time, he became increasingly preoccupied with ballet subjects. Normally the dancers are shown rehearsing or at rest, sometimes under the instruction of a recognisable male ballet maste; but many pictures focus on the dancers alone, anonymous members of the corps de ballet, harmoniously grouped as they practise or rest backstage.\n\nIn his scenes of modern life, Degas developed distinctive compositional techniques, viewing the subjects from unexpected angles and framing his compositions in unconventional ways, often cutting off figures and other forms at the margins of the picture, an effect clearly influenced by his interest in photography. Although this self-conscious artifice distinguishes his art from that of the Impressionist landscape painters and their concern with painting out of doors, Degas regularly exhibited in the Impressionist group exhibitions between 1874 and 1886. Throughout his career, Degas experimented with a great variety of techniques, and, from around 1880 onwards, increasingly explored the possibilities of pastel. From the late 1870s onwards he made a sequence of wax sculptures, of dancers, bathing women and horses. Sculpture was almost a private medium for Degas and the figures were radical when cast in bronze for their lack of monumentality and their often tender, unidealised forms.\n\nFailing eyesight in his last years restricted Degas’s production and may have contributed to the broadening of his technique, but this had little impact on the overall development of his career in its gradual shift from the explicit modernity of his scenes of the 1870s to the richer and more simplified colour effects of his later work.','France','Edgar','Degas',1834,1917,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Degas',1),(45,'Russian painter, printmaker, interior decorator, textile and fashion designer. Born in the Ukraine, Sonia Delaunay was active in France and the wife of Robert Delaunay. Perhaps more than any other modern artist, Delaunay forged a link between the fine and the applied arts. She was the youngest of three children and in 1890 was adopted at the age of five by her maternal uncle, Henri Terk, a lawyer in St Petersburg. She had early contacts with Germany, visiting the artist Max Liebermann in Berlin in 1899 and studying drawing with Ludwig Schmidt-Reutter (1863-1909) in Karlsruhe from 1903 to 1905. In 1905 she moved to Paris to study at the Académie de la Palette. There she met Amédée Ozenfant, André Dunoyer de Segonzac and Jean-Louis Boussingault. She learnt printmaking from Rudolf Grossmann (1882-1941). Her early painting was figurative, with references to Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin and the Fauves. She exhibited at the Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon at the Galerie Der Sturm, Berlin in 1913 and again at the Galerie Der Sturm in 1920 and 1921.\n\nDelaunay executed her first abstract work in 1911: a patchwork quilt for the cradle of her newborn son, Charles. Its contrasting intense colours suggested new ideas about space and movement to the Delaunays and together they pursued the study of colour, influenced by the theories of Michael Eugéne Chevreul. They adopted the stylistic label ‘simultaneity’ in order to distinguish their work, which sought to convey the dynamism of modern life by the juxtaposition of colour. Sonia realised that such juxtapositions need not be limited to a canvas but could extend to any other surface.\n\nIn 1912 Delaunay produced her first fabrics in her non-figurative series Contrastes Simultanés (1912; Paris, Pompidou) and her first simultaneous collages. In 1913, she made her first ‘simultaneous dress’ out of scraps of fabric to wear to the Bal Meunier in Montparnasse. She was already active as a designer of embroideries and bookbindings: her best-known book collaboration was with Blaise Cendrars, for whose La Prose du Transsibérien et de la petite Jehanne de France (published in October 1913 in the form of a vertical scroll almost two metres long) she designed a cover and pochoir illustrations.\n\nIn the 1930s, she returned to a renewed focus on painting, joining the Abstraction-Création group in seeking to create an art based upon non-representational elements, often geometrical, and continuing to focus on colour as central to her art. After her husband’s death in 1941, she continued to work as a painter and designer, turning often to printmaking as well. In 1963 she donated 58 of her own works and 40 of her husband’s to the Musée National d’Art Moderne, Paris, and became the first woman ever to be exhibited at the Louvre during her lifetime the following year when the museum mounted an exhibition of this gift.','Russia','Sonia','Delaunay-Terk',1885,1979,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Delaunay-Terk',1),(46,'British photographer. Susan Derges trained as a painter before turning to photography, and in particular to the cameraless photography for which she, along with contemporaries such as Adam Fuss and Garry Fabian Miller, has become internationally renowned. This simple, elegant process was used in very early photography and, in essence, allows the artist to fix shadows onto light sensitive paper. Removing the camera allows an almost alchemical transformation, to extraordinary and powerful effect.\n\nMuch of Derges’s recent work has been made at night in the open air; using the natural world as her darkroom she has quite literally invented a new way of making pictures. Derges has, for example, tracked the night sky with a camera and returned to the darkroom to combine camera-based and camera-less techniques that result in images that are at once recognisable, and yet not quite what they seem.\n\nSusan Derges has work in museums and public collections all over the world, including the Hara Art Museum, Tokyo and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In October 2010 Derges was one of five artists who took part in Shadow Catchers, a major survey of camera-less photography at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Under their guidance she became a skilled carver. She now works mostly in wood, stone and plaster in an atelier in Brooklyn. \n\nThe sculpture of Drake falls into two categories: mobiles in steel, and stabiles or semi-abstract forms carved in plaster and cast in bronze, of which this is an example. In both cases her work is abstract but with strong representational references.

Jean Dubuffet was one of France’s pre-eminent mid-20th-century artists, coining the term Art Brut for the style of raw, outsider production he favoured. As the son of a prosperous wine merchant in Le Havre, Dubuffet initially went into his father’s business after becoming disillusioned with his studies in Paris and growing sceptical of the artist’s privileged status. Drafted into the army in 1939, Dubuffet was briefly imprisoned for failing to salute an officer. After demobilisation, he found his wine trade flourishing but elected to lease it out and devote himself to art full-time, at the age of 41.\n\nDubuffet did not waste time during the next four decades: ‘For the first time I allowed myself carte blanche to paint in perfect liberty, and at top speed, without troubling to cast a critical gaze upon my work, and experimenting in all directions.’ He soon began to exhibit in Paris and attracted the attention of such intellectuals as the poets Paul Eluard and Henri Michaux and the critic Jean Paulhan (1884-1968). In 1945, soon after the Armistice, he and Paulhan journeyed to Switzerland to seek out examples of Art Brut. In 1947 Dubuffet sold his business and over the next few years went on three long visits to the Sahara, immersing himself in what he saw as the vital culture of a non-Western, pre-literate society.\n\nThe lively succession of provocative exhibitions in Paris from the mid-1940s had established Dubuffet as an important creative force in post-war art. His work, hitherto resolutely figurative, came close to abstraction in the 1950s and in 1961, encouraged by the Danish painter Asger Jorn, Dubuffet experimented with musical instruments and non-musical sounds, producing several eccentric records from his own tapes.\n\nThe 1970s was a time of ambitious sculptural and environmental projects, including important public commissions such as the Group of Four Trees (1970-2), in Chase Manhattan Plaza, New York. Following the establishment of the Dubuffet Fondation at Périgny-sur-Yerres in 1974 and the inauguration of the Collection de l’Art Brut at Lausanne in 1976, Dubuffet continued working until his death in 1985.','France','Jean','Dubuffet',1901,1985,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Dubuffet',1),(50,'Swedish artist and art theorist.

Born in 1886 in Ytterhoghal, Hälsingland, central Sweden, Leander Engström the Elder studied at the progressive Konstnärsförbund (Artists’ Union) in Stockholm under founder members Richard Bergh, Nils Kreuger and Karl Nordström. In 1907 Engström, along with fellow students, formed a radical group known first as the Young Ones (De Unga), then as the Men of the Year 1909 (1909 Års Män), which was particularly influenced by contemporary French art. Active between 1907-11, the group included such artists as Isaac Grünewald and Gösta Sandels. Most of the Young Ones, like Engström, had studied with Matisse in Paris, and were influenced by the expressive realism of van Gogh and Munch as well as the work of the Fauvists. Their Stockholm exhibitions (1909-11) of richly coloured, modernistic work instigated great debate as they represented the first artists to champion Swedish Expressionism.\n\nEngström took much inspiration from Sweden’s northern mountains around Abisko where he built himself a house, but also from his travels beyond: the landscapes of Denmark and Lapland (e.g. Scene from Lapland, 1916; Moderna Museet Stockholm), and the paintings of the Italian Primitives held particular sway. His later work became stronger yet simpler in their compositional structure, as is evident in his sculpture Wolf Killer (1915) and stylised painting Golden Evening in Assisi (1920), both held at Moderna Museet Stockholm. \n\nEngström married Maria Edlund in 1913.

After studying under various artists in Tumba and the surrounding areas, in 1922-3 Sven Erixson attended the Konsthögskolan in Stockholm and visited Berne, Nuremberg and Berlin. His early works, such as Jeårj (1923; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet), were loosely painted and naïve in appearance and drew on vernacular art. In 1924 he visited Paris and Italy, and in the following yearhe helped decorate the cinema in Malmö, one of numerous early decorative projects. In 1925 he was a founder member of the Fri Konst group of artists, which included Carl Alexandersson (1897-1941) and Sven Hempel (1896-1944) among others. The following year the membership was expanded to nine by the addition of such artists as Gustav Alexanderson to form the NioUnga (Nine Young Men) group. Erixson travelled extensively round Europe in the late 1920s, and in 1932, after the dissolution of NioUnga, he was a founder member of Färgoch Form (Colour and Form) with whom he exhibited thereafter. His painting of this period retained the earlier naïvetybut became more expressive, as in Dance Hall at Telemarken (1931; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet).\n\nAfter travels in Spain and Morocco in 1935-6,Erixson designed two large tapestry cartoons for the KonserthusGöteborg, which were executed by the Gobelins in France. In 1938-40 he executed two large frescoes for the chapel at Skogskyrkogården crematorium in Stockholm. From 1942-3 he produced painted glass windows for the St Gertrud chapel at Malmö crematorium, and in 1943 he became a professor at the Konstakademi in Stockholm. Erixson produced numerous theatrical set designs in the 1940s and 1950s, such as those for Federico García Lorca’s Blood Wedding (1944), Shakespeare’s Richard III (1946) and Romeo and Juliet (1953), which were performed at the Dramaten theatre in Stockholm. He continued to paint interior scenes, townscapes and landscapes in this period, such as Autumn in Tattby(1944; Göteborg, Konstmuseum), which still showed the influence of folk art. His later work was of much the same style though the details were pared away as in the powerful Memory of Nacka Hospital.

Concrete art, coined by Dutch artist and theorist Theo van Doesburg, stated that the work of art should be constructed purely of plastic elements – that is to say plans and colours, natural forms, lyricism and sentiment were strictly forbidden. With his streamlined focus on the diagonal theme, Falk is currently the leading proponent other thanOlleBaertling of the aesthetics of ‘open form’.

From 1910 he participated in the exhibitions of the Berlin Secession and from 1913 had contacts with Der Sturm Galerie in Berlin. His expressive early works included both sculptures and flat, geometric paintings. Having spent World War I in Cologne, from 1918-24 he lived in Berlin, where he was one of the founder members of the Novembergruppe in 1918, and contributed to the radical newspaper Die Aktion: ZeitschriftfürFreiheitlichePolitik und Literatur. In 1931 he was one of the first members of the group Abstraction-Création in Paris, where he then opened his own private academy.\n\nFrom the early 1920s,Freundlich developed a Constructivist style characterised by interlocking cellular forms, which was more elastic, rhythmic and colourful than his previous painting. Such compositions as My Sky is Red (1933; Paris, Pompidou) are based on an orthogonal framework, in which the right angles are twisted irregularly. The paintings contain elaborate systems of colour modulations which create complementary harmonies and degrees of spatial illusionism. The application of impastoed paint also creates a three-dimensional effect. Freundlich’s paintings often expressed his political views: his belief in ‘cosmic Communism’, for example, is associated with the colours in My Sky is Red. Freundlich’s work with stained glass from the early 1920s is closely linked with his abstract paintings and had the greatest influence on the development of his style.

Born NaumNeemia Pevsner, Gabo adopted a new surname to distinguish himself from his brother, the artist Antoine Pevsner. Gabo’s first constructed works were figurative but following his return to Russia in 1917 he started to make non-figurative reliefs and towers from transparent plastic and glass. In 1920 Gabo and his brother published the highly influential Realistic Manifesto. Rejecting Cubism and Futurism, Gabo called for an art for a new epoch, a public art recognising space and time as its basic elements and espousing construction and kineticism. In 1930 he had an important solo show at the Kestner-Gesellschaft in Hannover, and a year later became a member of the group Abstraction-Création in Paris. By 1933 Gabo had moved to Paris, but by 1936 had settled in London. There he made friends with Herbert Read, Leslie Martin and Ben Nicholson, with whom in 1937 he edited Circle: International Survey of Constructive Art. \n\nDissonanz is one of Gabo’s earliest oils, painted in Carbis Bay, Cornwall. Gabo moved to the county in 1939, two days after the outbreak of World War II. Materials were scarce so he was unable to continue working on constructivist sculptures; however, supplies for drawing and painting were more readily available. Writing to the young artist Peter Lanyon in 1942 he stated, ‘I have been interrupted by wars five times in my life and I know that they do end. What you cannot do with your hands, try to do in your imagination – make drawings and it will not be lost for you.’ \n\nGabo had always used drawings to investigate folding surfaces and spatial curvature, however his oil paintings were not simply studies or experiments for final constructions but finished works in themselves. They are clearly conceived from a sculptor’s mind: ‘I often turn to painting when the image of my experience becomes so involved in structure, in form and in colour that there is no possible way for me to execute in a three dimensional material,’ Gabo explained. Painting also provided him with an opportunity to use colour and texture as additional constructive elements. He enjoyed the nature of paint, often mixing his own colours. The vivid palette of Dissonanzreveals his Russian heritage. Its varied array of deep blues reverberate against the yellow core, creating an exciting friction on the surface of the painting. The central yellow area is made up of many different shades which allowed Gabo to explore the composition in a more three-dimensional way, as one might explore facets of a sculpture. \n\nDissonanzhas toured with two retrospective exhibitions of Naum Gabo’s work: the first starting in Amsterdam in 1965 and touring to Mannheim, Duisburg, Zürich, Stockholm and London; the second, in 1968, at the Albright-Knox Gallery, Buffalo.\n\nGabo’s Russian upbringing undoubtedly influenced his work; his sculptures and paintings reflect the coming together of 20th-century science, philosophy, revolution and utopian ideas that defined the nation. During his time in Russia he worked alongside Kandinsky, Malevich and Tatlin at the forefront of the Russian avant-garde, inheriting many formal aspects of their art.\n\nAs well as taking inspiration from his Russian roots, Gabo was also influenced by artists living around him during his time in Cornwall (1939-46). He became friends with members of the large colony of artists who lived in the area, including Peter Lanyon, Barbara Hepworth, Ben Nicholson, Patrick Heron and Adrian Stokes. Life in Cornwall stimulated Gabo’s interest in the natural world and he began collecting shells, stones, pieces of bone and driftwood, which was the practice of both Henry Moore and Hepworth. It was also in Cornwall that he started using nylon monofilament. \n\nIn 1946 Gabo moved to the USA, where he became a close friend of Lewis Mumford. Following a major exhibition of his work in New York in 1948, he began to receive commissions for public projects. Gabo’s style does not fit simply into the machine aesthetic. As he wrote in 1957: ‘Not the machine – the creative spirit of man is my inspiration.’ \n\nAn artist of diverse interests, Gabo was fascinated and influenced by scientific and mathematical images, whether visually or verbally described, and particularly by the enigmas of science. While he valued supremely the autonomy of the artist, he also sought to integrate, not only sculpture, architecture and design, but also art and science into everything he created. Thus he felt that his ‘constructive idea’ could serve as a philosophy not only for art but also for life in general.','American','Naum','Gabo',1890,1977,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naum_Gabo',1),(58,'French sculptor.

Grünewald was greatly inspired by Henri Matisse between 1910 and 1920 and by Fauvist art theories, influences of which can be seen clearly in the unnatural colours and shades of Barges at Kornhamn Square, depicting working barges docking in Stockholm. \n\nHis prize-winning design (1912-5) for decorating the Marriage Chamber in Stockholm City Law Courts was purely Fauvist but he was forbidden to execute the mural project. \n\nIn 1915 Grünewald exhibited together with his wife, Sigrid Hjertén, at the prestigious Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin. His debt to the various styles of French painting that he came into contact with can be seen in Ivan in the Armchair (1915; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet), while other paintings reveal Paul Cézanne as another early influence on his work. \n\nGrünewald was also a gifted portrait painter and illustrator, a typical example being Bullfighting (1917; Norrköpings, Konstmuseum).In 1921 Grünewald carried out the first of many stage designs for a production of Camille Saint-Saëns’ Samson and Delilah at the KungligaTeater, Stockholm. He was much sought after as a theatre designer during the 1920s, but also was commissioned to decorate the walls and ceiling in the minor hall (1926, now renamed Grünewald Hall) at the Stockholm Concert Hall, site of the Nobel Prize ceremony, as well as a main meeting room at the Matchstick Palace, Stockholm, in 1928. \n\nLatterly Grünewald abandoned Fauvism to produce work in a more Classical vein, while retaining some of his wilder gestures for landscape pictures such as the Coastal Landscape depicted here. Grünewald was a professor at the Art Academy in Stockholm from 1932 to 1942, and from 1942 ran his own painting school in the city. \n\nIn 1921 Grünewald carried out the first of many stage designs for a production of Camille Saint-Saëns’ Samson and Delilah at the KungligaTeater, Stockholm.

Francesco Guardi was born in Venice to a family from Trentino. He was famous for his vedute, or views, of Venice which show the strong influence of Canaletto and Luca Carlevarijs. In contrast, however, with Canaletto’s hard architectural line, Guardi’s style of painting was soft and sfumato, a smoky technique of scumbled brushstrokes which made his work especially popular with the later French Impressionist painters. \n\nThe Gateway of the Dolo was certainly a much beloved subject of Francesco Guardi. The prototype he followed for his most imposing views of the scene is that painted by Canaletto, now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, which also inspired Bernardo Bellotto and Giovanni Battista Cimaroli.\n\nGuardi also painted a number of other versions of the Porta del Dolo that on first sight look more like capricci than accurate views. This includes the present work, which contains very few buildings to distract from the little bridge over the Brentawith its busy figures. The view has been identified thanks to a drawing in the Correr Museum, Venice, with an inscription, possibly by the artist himself: VedutadellaPorta del Dolo per andar a Padova. This quick and concise drawing corresponds exactly to another painting in a private collection (London) which, together with one in the Assheton Bennett collection, is the only horizontal treatment of the theme.

Herbert James Gunn was born in Glasgow on 30 June, 1893. He studied at the renowned Glasgow School of Art and subsequently at the Edinburgh College of Art. Though a Scot by birth and artistic training, Gunn was to develop a stylevery much of his own, imbued with influences from French Impressionism and Modern British painting as well asfrom his Scottish heritage. \n\nFollowing his studies at Edinburgh, Gunn travelled to Paris, enrolling at the Académie Julian under Jean-Paul Laurens. He remained in Paris until 1914 when the threat of an unsettled continent forced him back to the UK. It was, however, during his time in France that Gunn developed a radical approach to compositional arrangements. His often-stark palette of grey tones was used to heighten the dramatic placement of forms and the current work is one of a series of small plein-air views in which Gunn captured the Parisian light throughthis elegant, sparing, execution.\n\nOn his return to England, Gunn rapidly established himself as a leading painter of portraits in addition to landscapes and conversation pieces. Gunn exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1923, at the Royal Scottish Academy and in Paris, where in 1931 he was awarded a silver medal at the Société Artistes Français and a gold medal at the Paris Salon of 1939. \n\nThroughout the 1930s and 1940s Gunn’s reputation as a portrait painter increased. He was to become the portrait painter of choice to society and the establishment. During 1953-4 Gunn reached his apogee as a portrait painter with the commission to paint the state portrait of H.M. The Queen. \n\nGunn was elected to the Royal Society of Portrait Painters in 1945, made President in 1953 and a Royal Academician in 1961.

An almost minimal refinement and economy of means has recently given way to robust forms which still remain very carefully considered in their configuration. These refer obliquely to mountain landscape, which alters dramatically when the viewer moves within it. \n\nSite-specific projects have also featured regularly throughout Hall’s career.

Hanson is among the most significant Nordic painters of his generation, having exhibited for more than 30 years. He attended the KungligaKonsthögskolan, Stockholm in 1979. Since his first major exhibition in 1985 at the ModernaMuseet in Stockholm, he has shownat theKunsthalle Düsseldorf in 1998 and Dunkers Kulturhus in Helsingborg in 2006. Hanson was the Nordic representative at the 1988 Venice Biennale, and received first prize in the Carnegie Art Award for the suite he painted Across the Staircasein 1999, inspired by Carl Fredrik Hill’s French paintings.Characteristic of Hanson’s oeuvre are abstract paintings with tension between picture-planeand three-dimensional plane, often in bright colours.\n\n\nHanson paints – he explained in a rare interview – using a vision that develops while he works, meaning that it is the process of painting that interests him: ‘It’s the same in music. You let it happen and experience what comes out directly.’ Hanson avoids what is common, stretching out into the unknown by the very act of painting. Hanson also holds an undeniable place in the painting of the 1980s, given how he worked on large-scale canvases with such an overpowering effect. One is immediately transported to another world; prior to language, prior to questions – beyond conclusions.\n\nHanson’s roots are to be found in turn-of-the-century symbolism; a quotation from Gustave Moreau was his sole comment to his exhibition at the ModernaMuseetin Sweden in 1985. ‘I do not believe in what I touch nor in what I see. I believe in what I cannot see and solely and exclusively in the message of my feelings.’\n\nHanson often works with variations of the same theme; explorations of form, and the ongoing interplay of surface and space in the compositions. His paintings show his colouristic sensitivity and ability to construct a condensed and complex pictorial space. The abstract compositions refer in part to associations with nature as well as imagined, mental landscapes, and are supported by a palette ranging from vivid colour fields to more subdued hues. Hanson lives and works in Stockholm and Portugal.','Sweden','Rolf','Hanson',1953,-1,1,'Post War Abstraction, Symbolist',1),(67,'Japanese painter, engraver, mixed-media artist and draftsman. Shoichi Hasegawa was born in Yaizu, Japan in 1929; he completed his studies in Tokyo before holding his first exhibition in his hometown in 1957. Determined to expand his knowledge of engraving, he left Japan for Paris, arriving in 1961. Studying under Stanley William Hayter in the Atelier 17, Hasegawa soon started to create abstract imagery, yet continued to use traditional Japanese materials. Initially his work was starkly linear, using only monochromatic tones of black into greys, but he swiftly moved beyond this, combining Eastern and Western influences to create his own unique style. Over a translucent background in the popular Parisian style of the time, tachisme (haphazard dabs and splotches used in lyrical abstraction), he engraved white decorative patterns in the Japanese tradition of popular imagery. \nThroughout the 1960s he exhibited in numerous group and solo shows in Europe (particularly Paris, Stockholm and Krakow) and North America (mainly Ottawa, Canada). In 1965 he won the Ljubljana International Engraving Exhibition Prize, followed in 1968 by the First Prize for Engraving at the International Exhibition of Como. \nOver the last 30 years, Hasegawa has mastered the art of transparency. In his etchings, where the paper is covered with only a thin layer of ink, details of the marks show through to create a depth rarely seen before. Hasegawa currently lives near the Seine where he has returned to his first choice of materials, ink and paper, to create engravings that once more combine modernist elements with traditional ones, a synthesis that has gained him international acclaim.\nHasegawa’s works can be found in the V&A, London, MoMA, New York, as well as museums in Norrköping, Paris and Oklahoma City.','Japan','Shōichi','Hasegawa',1929,-1,1,'',1),(68,'Swedish sculptor. Hans Hedberg was born in 1917 in the small port of Köpmanholmen, near Örnsköldsvik, almost 300 miles north of Stockholm. The port had been founded around a sawmill built by Hedberg’s grandfather, Gustav, in the late 19th century. After leaving boarding school in Stockholm in 1938, Hedberg, encouraged by his mother, became engrossed with painting. Although Sweden remained neutral during World War II, he carried out his military service with a platoon of Laplanders near the Norwegian border. \nFollowing the war, Hedberg spent short periods at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Art in Copenhagen and the AcadémieColarossi in Paris, before arriving in Capri in 1947. Inspired by the island’s pottery tradition he soon shifted his artistic talents towards this new medium. \nHe is now acclaimed for his oversized, brightly coloured fruit clay sculptures, such as the three examples here, but his early ceramics had a folk-like quality with a raw, uneven glazing. Hedberg entered into the fully charged social life of Capri meeting, among others, Peggy Guggenheim and writer Alberto Moravia. \n\nHans Hedberg’s formative Italian years continued from Capri to two years at the Istituto d’Arte della Ceramica in Faenza where, it is said, he was the first foreign post-war student. At this renowned centre for the production of faïence (tin-glazed earthenware) he combined his technical training with an introduction to prestigious Italian artists, such as sculptor Marino Marini and the more avant-garde Lucio Fontana.\n\nIt was in France, however, that Hedberg chose to settle, creating a studio and kiln in the pottery-making village of Biot, near Vallauris, in 1949. This was close to where Picasso was working with local potters. Five years later Hedberg held a one-man show at La Boutique d’Art in Nice establishing himself as a leading artist in the area. Picasso, Léger and Cocteau all visited his studio and Chagall stayed as a student (somewhat unsuccessfully) for three months. During this time he met his first wife Mouchka and, while keeping the studio in Biot, they moved to Haut, Cagnes-sur-Mer, an area oft cited as the ‘Montmartre of the Riviera’. They were together until her death in 1972. \n\nDuring the late 1950s and 1960s Hedberg began to abandon traditional modelling techniques in favour of casting from plaster moulds. He continued to push boundaries in the 1970s in his experimentation with new glazes, enamels and sheer size, with particular effect on his monumental ceramic egg series (one rose to almost a metre high). As well as creating free-standing sculptures Hedberg also produced large and varied reliefs, for buildings including the parish church in Köpmanholmen (1959) and the Faculty of Science at Marseille University (1960-6). His religious works were usually figurative, while at Marseille the colonnaded walkways are decorated with flat, Cubist planes and multi-linear patterns in brilliant colours suggesting both biological and atomic structures. \n\nIt was in his latter decades, however, that Hedberg created his most distinctive sculptures. These immense and perfectly ripe apples, pears, pumpkins and plums, with their hyper-real smoothness and bright, stoneware finish were soon joined by lemons and grapes, providing a contrast to the more tenuously shaped orange and turquoise sea anemones. \n\nHedberg won international awards throughout his career, the most notable being at the Ceramic Biennale in Vallauris. Every summer he would return to his native region in Sweden where, as a mark of his celebrated status, a museum dedicated to his work, was opened in 1988 close to the sea at Örnsköldsvik.

Jean Hélion was a painter whose abstract work of the 1930s established him as a leading Modernist. His mid-career rejection of abstraction was followed by nearly five decades as a figurative painter. He was also the author of several books and an extensive body of critical writing.\n\nIn 1929 Hélion produced his first abstract painting and, together with Theo van Doesburg, Otto Carlsund and the Armenian painter Leon Tutundjian, created the Art Concret group. He supervised the first, and only, issue of the journal Art Concret, in which he called for ‘pure painting, controlled by logic’, which describes the kind of orthogonally structured abstraction, related to Piet Mondrian, that he was painting at this time. This rather fundamentalist group later expanded into the Abstraction-Création movement, which included Jean Arp, Albert Gleizes, AugusteHerbin and Robert Delaunay. In the same period he met the British artists Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and John Piper. In America he became important for the generation of Arshile Gorky, Willem de Kooning and especially the American Abstract Artists group, through both his painting and his intellectually rigorous attitudes towards art.\n\nIn 1940 Hélion left America for war service in France. He was captured by the Germans but escaped from a prisoner of war camp and found his way back to the USA in 1942. He moved from Virginia to New York in 1944, and the city’s streets provided a range of figurative motifs, such as shop window mannequins and men smoking.\n\nIn 1946 Hélion returned to Paris, remaining in France for the rest of his career. His disavowal of radical abstraction proved as controversial in Paris as it had in New York, and he suffered considerable adverse criticism on this account. Between 1947 and 1952 he evolved a series of archetypal figures, ‘the newspaper reader’, ‘the nude model’, ‘the poet/outsider as passive witness’, which seem to reflect the mood of Existentialism then prevailing in Paris, and Hélion’s work at this time can be compared with that of BalthusKlossowskiand Alberto Giacometti. Grande Journalerie (1950), for example, with its rigid symmetry, its aggressive drawing and acid colour, is determinedly anti-sentimental. The 1970s and 1980s saw a revival of appreciation from a younger generation of artists and critics that was reflected by his inclusion in A New Spirit in Painting (1981; London, Royal Academy), Panorama de l’ArtFrançais, 1960-80 (1982; Vienna) and Peinture en France (1984; Venice, Biennale).','France','Jean','Hélion',1904,1987,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Helion',1),(70,'French painter. AugusteHerbin studied drawing at the École des Beaux-Arts, Lille, from 1898 to 1901, when he moved to Paris. His initial influences, of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, as seen in early workshe submitted to the Salon desIndépendants in 1906, gradually gave way to an involvement with Cubism onceHerbin moved to the Bateau-Lavoir studios, where he met Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Juan Grisin 1909. After producing his first abstract paintings in 1917, he came to the attention of Léonce Rosenberg, who included Herbin in a number of shows at his Gallerie de l’EffortModernein 1918 and 1921.\n\nHerbin’s radical reliefs of simple geometric forms in painted wood challenged not only the status of the easel painting but also traditional figure-ground relationships. The incomprehension that greeted these reliefs and related furniture designs, even from those critics most favourably disposed towards Cubism, was such that until 1926 or 1927 he followed Rosenberg’s advice to return to a representational style. Herbin himself later disowned landscapes, still lifes and genre scenes of this period although as a member of the Communist party, Herbin found himself under pressure to practice an illustrative, moralising art.\n\nHis resolute belief in abstraction culminated in 1931 when he co-founded the Abstraction-Création groupwith Georges Vantongerloo. Herbin’s interest in colour theory culminated in the publication of his l’Art non-figuratif non-objectif(1949, Paris), in which he established a system of correspondences between colours, forms, notes of music and letters of the alphabet. In the 1950s he initiated the Salon des RéalitésNouvelles, of which he remained a member until 1955.\n\nHerbin’sresolute belief in abstraction culminated in 1931 when he co-founded, as president, the Abstraction-Création group with vice-president Georges Vantongerloo. As its full title suggests (Abstraction-Création: Art non-figuratif) the group embraced abstraction in its many facets: the idealist slant of late Cubism (represented by Albert Gleizes, Jean Hélion and Herbin), the geometrical tendency of De Stijl (represented by Piet Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg and Vantongerloo), and an émigré version of Constructivism (represented by the expatriate brothers Naum Gabo and Antoine Pevsner). Often seen as superseding the Parisian Cercle et Carré, this association grew rapidly in size to include more than 50 members.\n\n\nHerbin’s interest in colour theory culminated in the publication of his l’Art non-figuratif non-objectif(1949, Paris). Within this he created his visual alphabet in which he assigned a geometric form, colour and tone to each letter. He incorporated this alphabet into his working method: he would select a word, identify each letter, link that letter to the form and colour laid down in his alphabet, and then arrange the shapes and colours in such a way as to balance the surface of the painting, such as in Friday I (1951; Paris, Pompidou).\n\nIn the 1950s Herbin initiated the Salon des RéalitésNouvelles, of which he remained a member until 1955. He remained a strong influence among young abstract painters and continued his experimental style by applying his abstract theories to tapestry designs.\n\nHerbin died in Paris in 1960, but his paintings continue to be regularly included in major exhibitions around the globe. His work can be seen in international museums including Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, MoMA, New York, Muséed’ArtModerne de la ville de Paris, the Tate, London and Musée de Grenoble.','France','Auguste','Herbin',1882,1960,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Herbin',1),(71,'English sculptor. Hepworth trained at Leeds School of Art in 1919 and at the Royal College of Art, London, from 1920 to 1924, where she was associated with other artists from Leeds, including Henry Moore. Hepworth made an isolated venture into piercing the form in 1931 with a carving in alabaster, Abstraction, a line of enquiry developed by Moore before Hepworth was to return to it. Hepworth’s carvings up to the mid-1930s are chunky, resolutely solid and basically figurative, displaying much less interest in the ‘savage’ side of non-Western carving than those of Moore. Her development of piercing and of a progressive opening of form to light and space ran parallel to a process of refinement in her work through the 1940s, epitomised in Pelagos (1946; London, Tate). During this period she rid her work of references to the human body, venturing as early as 1936 from biomorphic to crystalline forms while never abandoning her liking for curves.\n\nHepworth met and married Ben Nicholson in 1931-32 after her divorce from her first husband Hugh Skeaping. Together with Moore and other English Modernists, they were enthusiastically promoted by Herbert Read and other critics. During the 1930s Nicholson and Hepworth visited a number of artists in France, including Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Hans Arp and Constantin Brancusi, becoming especially close to those practising geometric abstraction. In 1933 they joined Abstraction-Création and were founder members of Unit One, a group of architects, painters and sculptors committed to Constructivism or Surrealism. From 1935 she exhibited with the 7 & 5 Society, and in 1936 she took part in a seminal exhibition, Abstract & Concrete. Together with a group of eminent European exiles who arrived in London in the mid-1930s, including Piet Mondrian, Naum Gabo and László Moholy-Nagy, she and other English artists based in Hampstead became the centre of an informal but intellectually cohesive group committed to avant-garde ideas.\n\nJust before the outbreak of World War II, Hepworth and Nicholson went to stay with the critic Adrian Stokes in Carbis Bay, near St Ives, Cornwall, where they were joined by Gabo. Hepworth made St Ives her permanent home. In compliance with the wishes expressed before her death, her former studio and home became the Barbara Hepworth Museum and was opened in 1980 as an outpost of the Tate.','England','Barbara','Hepworth',1903,1975,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Hepworth',1),(72,'Swedish painter and draughtsman. Carl Fredrik Hill grew up in the university city of Lund, where his father was a mathematics professor. Despite severe opposition from his father, he studied landscape painting at the Konstakademi in Stockholm (1871-72) under Johan Edvard Bergh and Per Daniel Holm (1835-1903). He also frequently copied Dutch Old Masters, particularly Jacob van Ruisdael. After seeing the work that Alfred Wahlberg had sent home from Paris, Hill began to abandon his initial approach to form and colour, resulting in his trip to Paris in November 1873. His most important experience there was his encounter with the painting of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot: ‘Corot has discovered a new world, because he has discovered a new way of looking at the old,’ he wrote in a letter. Other contemporary French painters Hill admired were Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, Charles-François Daubigny, Jean-François Millet and Théodore Rousseau. From GustaveCourbet he learnt how to use colour to suggest the surface texture of stone quarries and gravel hills. In Barbizon in 1874 and 1875 Hill met the Hungarian painters LászlóPaál and Mihály von Muncácsy. His paintings of this time, for example Autumn Landscape, Evening: Fontainebleau (1875; Malmö, Art Museum), are characterised by their dark ‘luminarism’ and their debt to Corot’s later works.\n\nUnder the influence of Impressionism, the dark bitumen colours disappeared from Hill’s painting in 1876. Hill called this approach ‘the most realistic’ and considered that he had discovered his true painting style. However, he never adopted typical Impressionism style, even though he used a broad, painterly technique and often employed a palette knife. His development was rapid and he worked at a feverish pitch. In 1875 he was represented at the Paris Salon, but he was forced to exhibit his more radical paintings of 1876 in the Salon des Refusés that year. He was also represented at the Exposition Universelle in 1878. He had few contacts with other Swedes in Paris because of his reclusive character. He preferred to live and work near the countryside, moving in 1876, after his time in Barbizon, to the towns of Champagne-sur-Oise, Montigny-sur-Loing and Luc-sur-Mer, and in 1877 to Bois-le-Roi on the Seine.','Sweden','Carl Fredrik','Hill',1849,1911,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Fredrik_Hill',1),(73,'Swedish painter.

Having decided to become a painter, Hjertén studied at Henri Matisse’s academy in Paris from 1909 to 1911. There she met the Swedish painter Isaac Grünewald, who she married in 1911. The same year Hjertén wrote an article about Paul Cézanne’s work in SvenskaDagbladet. This was probably the first article about Cézanne’s work to be published in Sweden. Along with Grünewald, and other painters who had studied at Matisse’s academy, she introduced French Modernism to the country. In 1915 Hjertén and Grünewald exhibited at Herwarth Walden’s Der Sturm Galerie, Berlin. Besides Matisse, both Futurism and German Expressionism influenced Hjertén’s work.\n\nHjertén’s paintings from 1914-19 are of particular importance. In Interior of a Studio and The Red Blind (both 1916; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet) she expressed her conscious and unconscious response to life as a woman, a painter and a mother. The hostility and harsh criticism that Hjertén and Grünewald met when they exhibited Modernist work during the 1910s, however, made Hjertén retire from the official art scene until a retrospective exhibition in 1936. Between 1920 and 1930 Hjertén and Grünewald lived in Paris. During the 1930s Hjertén experimented with colour and made strong colouristic compositions inspired, for example, by her observations of the harbour in Stockholm and by her travels to the south of Europe.

He travelled to Paris in 1921 where he studied under Emile-Antoine Bourdelle until 1924. In Paris he was influenced by Cubism and produced such sculptures as the current work,Cubist Girl (also in Stockholm, ModernaMuseet), while the influence of vernacular art is evident in the expressive Girl’s Head (wood, 1922). He participated in various group exhibitions in Paris, Stockholm and elsewhere in the late 1920s. During this time his painting began to show the influence of the Swedish folk art tradition, as in the Näively executed At the Kitchen Table (1923; Göteborg, Art Museum). This tradition supplanted the influence of Cubism in his sculpture, leading to more realistic works such as Girl with Violin (bronze, 1929; Stockholm, Modern Museum).\n\nHe worked in Copenhagen in 1938 and 1939 producing reliefs for Skogskyrkogårdens Crematorium in Stockholm.

His painted wood reliefs, such as Bernadette of Lourdes (1943; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet), are roughly carved and in the same Expressive style as his paintings. \n\nIn 1932 Hjorthwas a co-founder of Färgoch Form (Colour and Form), an association of artists that was born out of the economic crisis of the 1930s. They sold directly to the public through their exhibition space located at Stureplan in Stockholm, thus circumnavigating the system of dealers. Under their sponsorship he received his first one-man show in 1935 in Stockholm and he exhibited with the group regularly.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1959 Hjorthbecame Professor of Drawing at the Konsthögskola in Stockholm, and from 1951 to 1953 he visited Paris, Italy and Greece. Religious themes recur in his painting, as in Jesus and Mary Magdalene (1958) which has the firm outlines and uniform colouring characteristic of his works from the later 1950s. The same spirit is evident in his later sculptures, for example Dance Group (papier-mâché, 1959; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet). In 1963 Hjorth painted the Entry into Jerusalem for Salabacke Church in Uppsala. His sculpture Water Sprite Polka (bronze, 1960) was installed in front of the railway station in Uppsala in 1967. Reducing the forms to a minimum it consists of a column with a figure and waterlilies surmounted by a dancing couple. Along with Sven Erixson, Hjorth was influential in revitalising the folk art tradition in Sweden.','Sweden','Bror','Hjorth',1894,1968,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bror_Hjorth',1),(75,'French painter. Jean-Auguste Dominique Ingres was trained first by his father, a sculptor in Montauban, then at the Toulouse Academy, before entering the Paris studio of Jacques-Louis David in 1797. Ingres was a curious and contradictory figure, yet one of the greatest French painters of the 19thcentury. Despite his lifelong devotion to the antique and to the example of RaffaelloSanzio da Urbino(Raphael), he was, as much as his Romantic rival EugèneDelacroix, in rebellion against the academic norms imposed by the school of David, though he continued to admire the personal achievement of his master. He was an establishment painter with a highly idiosyncratic and emotionally charged style. He exhibited at the 1824 Paris Salon; the RaphaelesqueVow of Louis XIII was the first of Ingres’s paintings to win near universal acclaim.\n\nIn January 1825 he was awarded the Légiond’Honneur, but was so outraged when critics disparaged hisMartyrdom of Saint Symphorien, shown in the Salon of 1834, that he left France for Rome, vowing never to work for the government again. Ingres returned to Paris in June 1841, when King Louis-Philippe received him personally for a tour around Versailles, an honour he felt his status befitted. The artist worked tirelessly through his seventies and died of pneumonia aged 86, still the undisputed master of Neo-classical style.\n\nIngres, a consummate draughtsman, frequently stated that ‘drawing is the probity of art’, yet in purely academic terms his drawing is often deliberately defective and exaggerated. But as other great draughtsmen have recognised, Edgar Degas and Pablo Picasso among them, the force and strangeness of Ingres’s art lies in his subtle and often unnaturalistic orchestration of contour – so that outline rather than volume is the organising principal of his paintings – and also in his efforts to produce a painted surface of such smoothness that almost no trace of human intervention remains.','France','Jean-Auguste-Dominique','Ingres',1780,1867,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Auguste-Dominique_Ingres',1),(76,'Swedish painter. After studying in Stockholm, EinarJolinworked under Henri Matisse in Paris from 1908 to 1911 and in 1913 exhibited at the Salon d’Automne. The influence of Matisse is strongly evident in such early paintings as On the Beach (1917; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet), with its bright colour and strong outlines. He travelled in Italy (1920-2), North Africa (1922-3) and Spain (1924). These travels inspired a number of works, such as Outside the Town: Scene from Kairouan (1923; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet), of which he flattened the space and reduced the figures and other elements to simple geometric forms. His later style was more naturalistic and restrained in colour, as is demonstrated by Still-life with White Flowers (1938; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet) and Woman in Black (1942; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet).\n\nJolin initially exhibited with the so-called Men of 1909, all of whom were similarly influenced by Matisse and the Fauvists, but he was also named as one of the Swedish Expressionists in 1915, showing alongside Sigrid Hjertén, Edward Hald and the influential Isaac Grünewald, who argued that painting should be a feast for the eye, and with whom Jolin often collaborated. Perhaps the later Swedish phenomenon of naïvism– an art rooted in folk culture and imagination – better describes Jolin’s pale, somewhat delicate pictures of Stockholm life, in which the composition is carefully worked out,but the figures and landscape elements freely interpreted, as in the two examples included here.','Sweden','Einar','Jolin',1890,1976,1,'',1),(77,'Swedish artist. Born in Malmö, Erik Jönsson studied during the spring of 1915 at the AlthinsMålarskola in Stockholm. He remained there until 1917, when he travelled to Copenhagen and became a private student of Johan Rodhe. After the end of the World War I, he travelled in 1919 through England to Paris, where he became a student of André Lhote in 1920. Around 1924-5 he also studied for some time under Maurice Denis. He spent the summers in various locations in the French countryside, among other places, in Meudon, Montigny and Chartres, from where many of his earlier landscapes are derived. In 1929 he returned home where he settled in Malmö.\n\nJönsson’s first showing of his paintings was at the Scania’s Art Society’s Autumn Exhibition in Malmö in 1918. In 1920, he exhibited together with three colleaguesin Stockholm as The 1920 November Group. In 1925 he appeared in Lund together with Martin Emond and GustafMalmström and in the same year he was elected as a member of the group The Twelve. In 1927 he held his first one-man exhibition in Stockholm (The Little Exhibition). In connection with Jönsson’s 50thbirthday in 1943, a retrospective exhibition of his art was shown at Malmö Konstmuseum. Commemorative exhibitions have also been organised, at Malmö in 1952 (catalogue with an introduction by S. Sandström) and by the National Association for Fine Arts in 1953 (travelling exhibition – Three Scanian painters; also including Svante Bergh and Johan Johansson; catalogue with an introduction by K.

Georges Jouve was born to decorator parents in the Parisian suburb of Fontenay-sous-Bois in 1910, and attended the city’s esteemed École Boulle aged 17. After graduating in art history and sculpture, his initial artistic career began in theatre design which he continued to study at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière and Académie Julian in Paris. During World War II, Jouve was taken prisoner at Lorraine in 1940 then interned in a German camp before escaping to Nyons. Settling in Dieulefit, Drône, a village known for its potters, Jouve created many decorative pieces, the majority of which had a sacred or ritualistic focus. It was here that he met sculptor Etienne-Martin and writer and art collector Henri Pierre Roché. \n\nIn 1944 he was invited by JacquesAdnet, furniture designer and Director of La Compagnie des Arts Français, Paris, to join his team of decorators which included Charlotte Perriand and François Jourdain. Jouve moved his family to Paris, setting up a studio in rue de la TombeIssoire. As well as exhibiting with Perriand and Isamu Noguchi at the prestigious GalerieSteph Simon, Saint-Germain des Pres, he participated annually in many Salons in France and also internationally as a member of the Salon des Artistes Decorateurs. \nHe moved to Aix-en-Provence in 1954 and took part in Art Wall, an exhibition organised by Artistic Action Abroad and which travelled the globe including shows in Cairo, Rio de Janeiro, Montreal, Washington, Helsinki, and Tokyo.

Born in Mumbai, AnishKapoor has lived and worked in London since the early 1970s when he moved to study art, first at the Hornsey College of Art and later at the Chelsea School of Art and Design. He became known in the 1980s for his geometric or biomorphic sculptures made using simple materials such as granite, limestone, marble, pigment and plaster.\n\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s he was acclaimed for his explorations of matter and non-matter, specifically evoking the void in both freestanding sculptural works and ambitious installations. Many of his sculptures seem to recede into the distance, disappear into the ground or distort the space around them. Since 1995, he has worked with the highly reflective surface of polished stainless steel. These works are mirror-like, reflecting or distorting the viewer and surroundings. Over the course of the following decade Kapoor’s sculptures ventured into more ambitious manipulations of form and space.\n\nHe represented Britain in the XLIV Venice Biennale in 1990, when he was awarded the PremioDuemila Prize. In 1991 he received the Turner Prize and in 2002 received the Unilever Commission for the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern.

Polish-born Ladislas Pierre Kijno studied philosophy in the mid-1920s, particularly the work of Jean Grenier. Grenier was particularly interested in the development of non-figurative art and wrote mainly on the subject of contemporary painting, his philosophy adopting the Taoist principle of Wu-Wei (‘revolution through non-action’). From 1945 Kijno worked in the studio of Germaine Richier, the French sculptor who combined Classical forms with human/animal hybrids. Located in Paris since the late 1950s, Kijno uses spray painting as his primary form of expression and has become one of the masters of the froissage technique. Froissage is a method of collage developed by LadislavNovák in which the lines are made by crumpling up a piece of paper to create a drawing. \n\nKijno’s meeting with Surrealists Louis Aragon and Francis Ponge in 1943 led to a number of works being created in collaboration with poets. In 1971 he had two retrospectives at the Museum of Le Havre and the cultural centre of Rennes.

Michael Landy grew up in East London and studied fine art at Goldsmiths College, University of London, alongside other Young British Artists (YBAs) such as Damien Hirst, Gary Hume and Sarah Lucas. Landy quickly developed a reputation for large-scale confrontational installations about capitalism, consumerism and the value of art.In 1992 he started an association with Karsten Schubert by making Closing Down Sale for his gallery, which was followed by Scrapheap Services (1995-6), which featured a fictitious cleaning company that sought to change society by way of ‘a minority of people being discarded’.\n\nBreak Down, the work that put Landy in the public eye, was held in February 2001 at an old branch of the clothes store C&A on Oxford Street in London. Landy gathered all his possessions, ranging from postage stamps to his car, including all his clothes and works of art by himself and others, and then destroyed them all in public. The process of destruction was done on something resembling an assembly line in a mass production factory, with workers shredding each of the painstakingly catalogued 7,227 items.\n\nLandy’sArt Bin installation for the South London Gallery in 2010 was described by the artist as ‘a monument to creative failure’. A large transparent skip was installed at the gallery, into which he invited the public to throw art work with which they were dissatisfied. Artists and collectors were invited to apply to dispose of works of art via a dedicated website. The drawing displayed here is a homage to the self-destruction machines of the late Swiss artist Jean Tinguely, whose work Landy first saw as an 18-year-old student at a Tate retrospective in 1982.Landy later made a documentary, also titled H.2.N.Y.,whichcharts his fascination with Tinguely’s 1960 art work Homage to New York, the most famous of his auto-destruct machines.

Henry Herbert La Thangue was born in Croydon, studied at the South Kensington Schools, the Lambeth School of Art and the Royal Academy Schools (1874-9); he won the Royal Academy gold medal and then went to Paris for three years to study at the École des Beaux-Arts. La Thangue came into contact with Stanhope Forbes while studying and together they travelled around France, spending time painting amongst the artists’scolonies of Cancarle, Pont Aven and Quimperle. During this time in France, La Thangue became a true follower of Jules Bastien-Lepage and was influenced by both his techniques of using a cut square brush and his theories on Ruralist subject matter. \n\nIn Faggott Gatherers the scene is autumnal. The drainage dyke to the left reflects a leaden sky and the field workers have been occupied in thinning winter copses and laying in winter fuel. As Kenneth McConkey has pointed out, though the subject had exerted a powerful fascination on artists for several generations, it was Jean-François Millet who addressed it for La Thangue’s generation.\n\nLa Thangue returned to England in 1884, settling first in Norfolk, then Kent, before he moved to Sussex in 1890. He focused on painting primarily peasant scenes, soon establishing an international reputation and exhibiting works abroad at the Paris Exposition in 1900 and at exhibitions held in Venice (1903) and Rome (1911). In 1913 he became a Royal Academician and a year later held his first solo show at the Leicester Galleries where his work received much critical acclaim, provoking the staunch support of British artist Walter Sickert (1860-1942). \n\nHe had first observed processions of field workers during his time in rural France in 1883. The experience would find its first expression in his paintings in 1886, with Return of the Reapers (1886; London, Tate), in which a young girl dressed in white walks thoughtfully outwards from the canvas and towards the viewer, carrying farming implements across her shoulders. The confrontational nature of the composition was perhaps inspired by Jules Bastien-Lepage’sLe Père Jacques, shown at the Salon in Paris in 1882.','England','Henry Herbert','La Thangue',1859,1929,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Herbert_La_Thangue',1),(85,'French painter and designer. Fernand Léger was born in Argentan in Normandy of peasant farming stock. As a schoolboy, he never took an interest in anything but drawing and gymnastics.In 1897-9Léger was apprenticed to an architect in Caen, then in 1900 settled in Paris, where he supported himself as an architectural draughtsman (and for a while as a photographic retoucher), whilst studying art at the Académie Julian and elsewhere. His early paintings were Impressionist in style, but in 1907 he was overwhelmed by the Léger exhibition of Cézanne’s work at the Salon d’automme. Although regarded as one of the major figures of the Cubist movement he always stood somewhat apart from its central course, disjointing forms but not fragmenting them in the manner of Braque and Picasso, preferring bold tubular shapes. In 1912 he had his first solo exhibition. He was just beginning to prosper when World War I interrupted his career. By this time his work had come close to complete abstraction.\n\nLéger enlisted in the army, served as a sapper in the front line, then as a stretcher-bearer. He was at the Front in World War I and spent three months in Verdun where, he said, ‘a soldier made his bed with a shovel.’After being gassed, he spent over a year in hospital and was discharged in 1917. During that time he painted Soldiers Playing at Cards (Otterlo, Kröller-Müller), which he regarded as ‘the first picture in which I deliberately took my subject from our own epoch’. He returned from this ordeal with a profound appreciation of the human qualities of the common man to which, as he observed, he himself belonged, and with the conviction, no doubt inspired by the Futurists, that the breech of a canon was a formally beautiful object more relevant than all the artistic subject matter favoured in the past. Like so many others of his generation, Léger imagined that the Russian revolution held the promise of a renewal of mankind and the brief triumph of the Popular Front in France suggested that this was really the age of the common man. Léger later joined the French Communist Party, but he never shifted in his work to the Socialist Realism favoured by Communist leaders.\n\nOver the next few years, Léger’s work showed a fascination with machine-like forms; even his human figures were depicted as almost robot-like beings. Summing up much of European modernism during the first two decades of the century, Léger combined machine ideals with synthetic Cubist decoration, touches of Russian Constructivism and De Stijl design elements.In 1920 he met Charles-ÉdouardJeanneret(Le Corbusier) and AmédéeOzenfant, who shared his interest in a machine aesthetic, and in the mid-1920s his work became flatter and more stylised, in line with their Purist style. He used bold, poster-like contrasts of form and colour, with strong black outlines and extensive areas of flat, uniform colour.\n\nAs a result of his association with this Purist movement, Leger wrote in 1925, ‘The painter is caught between a realistic figure and an invented figure, which becomes the object and the subject. It is necessary to retain what is useful in the subject and to extract from it the best part possible. I try to create a beautiful object with mechanical elements... Plastic beauty is totally independent of sentimental, descriptive and imitative values. Each object, picture, architectural work and decorative arrangement has value in itself, absolute and independent of what it may represent.’\n\nAs the son of a cattleman Léger always believed in the strength of ordinary men and so was undoubtedly the most class conscious of the early Modernists. Anti-bourgeoisie and pro-working class, he expressed the new needs and forms of urban life through the lyrical rhythms in painting, film, architectural decoration and theatre design. Léger was also a prolific writer who penned countless theoretical essays on the social functions of art as well as the aesthetic components of painting. According to Roger Fry, Leger... ‘was perhaps the most public artist of his time. Alone among the radically minded “high artists” of the inter-war period, he never quite gained the mass response from working-class society that he craved.’\n\nThe ‘modest and little’ Statue of Liberty, a gift from his country, did not impress Léger as he watched from the deck of a liner sailing into the inner harbour of New York Bay in 1931. But the artist was immediately fascinated by the sight of the Manhattan skyline, describing it in a French art magazine as ‘the most colossal spectacle in the world’. Léger had arrived for his first of four stays in the United States, including five years of exile during World War II. This left a lasting impact on his work, which, during the war years, also included pictures of acrobats, cyclists and musicians. After his return to France in 1945, however, he began to concentrate on the human figure. \n\nIn 1945 Léger wrote that, ‘The object in modern painting must become the main character and overthrow the subject. If, in turn, the human form becomes an object, it can considerably liberate possibilities for the modern artist.’ He elaborated on this idea in his 1949 essay, How I Conceive the Human Figure, where he wrote that, ‘abstract art came as a complete revelation, and then we were able to consider the human figure as a plastic value, not as a sentimental value. That is why the human figure has remained wilfully inexpressive throughout the evolution of my work.’ As the first painter to take as his idiom the imagery of the machine age, and to make the objects of consumer society the subjects of his paintings, Léger has been called a progenitor of Pop Art.\n\nDuring the last 15 years of his life, Léger’s style reverted to a distinctive figurative mode. Although his series dealing with circus folk, cyclists, divers, construction teams and acrobats are handled in a quasi-realistic manner, superimposed or paralleled by independent flashes of colour, they are neither imitative nor poetic but descriptive of the plastic contrasts that remained at the vortex of his art throughout his career. Technological progress increasingly became a concern, rather than an inspiration, for him as he came to believe that the advent of the machine in the workplace did not relieve the labourer of the workload or humanise the working environment. Natural phenomena, including trees and flowers, and rural scenes such as this image of a milkmaid, were Léger’s antidotes to this oppression. \n\nMany honours came to him late in life, including the Grand Prix at the 1955 São Paulo Biennal. Shortly before his death he bought a large house inBiot, France, where his widow built a museum of his work. JohnGolding wrote of Léger: ‘No other major 20th-century artist was to react to, and to reflect, such a wide range of artistic currents and movements. Fauvism, Cubism, Futurism, Purism, Neo-Plasticism, Surrealism and Classicism, his art experienced them all, and yet he was to remain supremely independent as an artistic personality. Never at any time in his career could he be described as a follower; the very vigour and strength of his character would in themselves have rendered such a position inconceivable. But his originality lay in his ability to adapt the ideas, and to a certain extent the visual discoveries of others, to his own ends.’','France','Fernand','Léger',1881,1955,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernand_Leger',1),(86,'American painter. Central to the Pop Art movement, Roy Lichtenstein was born in New York and trained from 1940 until 1949 at Ohio State University, but was interrupted by military service from 1943-6. His early work embraced Cubist, Geometrical and Abstract Expressionist elements but in the early 1960s, teaching at Rutgers University, Lichtenstein painted his first comic-strip works. Shown at the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1962, they were an instant success and Lichtenstein moved to New York in 1963, ceasing teaching in 1964. The comic-strip paintings, of which Whaam! (1963; London, Tate) is an outstanding example, took popular commercial images, refined them, enlarged them, and imitated their method of reproduction by including the Ben Day dots with which newspaper images were printed. This technique emphasised the clichés of popular imagery while also endowing them with iconic status. Having elevated the comic book to fine art, Lichtenstein used the same technique to reduce high art to the level of a comic by adapting details from paintings by Pablo Picasso and other masters and rendering both techniques and styles in elegant and humorous pastiche.','America','Roy','Lichtenstein',1923,1997,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Lichtenstein',1),(87,'Swedish painter. Bruno Liljefors studied at the Konstakademi in Stockholm (1879-82). During a trip abroad in 1882-3 he attended lectures in Düsseldorf by the German animal painter Carl Friedrich Deikerand made animal studies at the city zoo, one of the largest in Europe. He concluded his travels by visiting France in 1883-4 and again in 1886. For a while he was a member of the Scandinavian artists’ colony in Grez-sur-Loingand he exhibited at the Salon de Paris in 1884. The influence of both French plein-air painting and Japanese woodcuts is apparent in his first important work, Hawk and Black Game (1884; Stockholm Nationalmuseum), a ‘close-up’ of nature that fills the whole picture surface. \n\nAll his life Liljefors was a hunter, and he often painted predator/prey action, the hunts engaged between fox and hare, sea eagle and eider, and goshawk and black grouse serving as prime examples. However, he never exaggerated the ferocity of the predator or the pathos of the prey, and his pictures are devoid of sentimentality. Liljefors was fascinated by the patterns to be found in nature, and he often made art out of the camouflage patterns of animals and birds. He particularly loved painting capercaillies against woodland, and his most successful painting of this subject is the large-scale CapercaillieLek (1888), in which he captures the atmosphere of the forest at dawn. \n\nDuring the last years of the 19th century a brooding element entered his work, perhaps the result of turmoil in his private life, as he left his wife, Anna, and took up with her younger sister, Signe, and was often short of money. He amassed a collection of animals to act as his living models. Ernst Malmberg recalled: ‘The animals seemed to have an instinctive trust and actual attraction to him...There in his animal enclosure, we saw his inevitable power over its many residents – foxes, badgers, hares, squirrels, weasels, an eagle, eagle owl, hawk, capercaillie and black game.’\n\nThe greatness of Liljefors lay in his ability to show animals in their environment. Sometimes he achieved this through hunting and observation of the living animal, and sometimes he used dead animals: for example his Hawk and Black Game, painted in the winter of 1883-4, was based on dead specimens, but he also used his memory of the flocks of black grouse in the meadows around a cottage he once lived in at Ehrentuna, near Uppsala. Liljefors was a pioneer at a time when wildlife art was still emerging from its association with scientific depiction and taxidermy. He set a standard of identification with the landscape which substantially influenced the subsequent development of wildlife art in the 20thcentury.','Sweden','Bruno','Liljefors',1860,1939,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Liljefors',1),(88,'Englishpainter. The son of a frame maker, John Linnell came to the notice of connoisseurs and artists at an early age: he visited Benjamin West in 1804 while Joseph Farington mentioned Sir George Beaumont’s interest in Linnell’s sketches. In 1805 he entered the Royal Academy Schools and became a pupil of JohnVarley. He participated in the naturalist movement of the early 19th century, making oil sketches from nature along the Thames (e.g. Study of Buildings – Study from Nature, 1806; London, Tate), in the company of William Henry Hunt and William Mulready. His friendship with Cornelius Varley led in 1811-2 to his entry into the Baptist church and a more intense interest in humble landscapes, often including labourers at work (e.g. Kensington Gravel Pits, 1812; London, Tate). In the following decade he made several sketching tours, including a trip to north Wales with George Robert Lewis in 1813, and produced remarkably fresh watercolour sketches. He exhibited his oils at the Society of Painters in Oil and Water-Colours from 1813 until 1820. With his marriage in 1817 and the onset of family responsibilities, he turned his attention to portraiture. He acquired royal and aristocratic patronage and executed a miniature of Princess Sophia Matilda(1821; British Royal College, London), the daughter of William Henry, Duke of Gloucester. Large-scale portraits in oil, such as Lady Torrens and her Family (1820; New York, Mrs. Richard Selle private collection) show the influence of leading portrait painter Thomas Lawrence.\n\nLinnell played an important part in the last years of William Blake’s life from 1818, commissioning the engravings for the Book of Jobin 1823 and the watercolours for Dante’s Divine Comedy in 1824, and giving Blake a regular income in his old age. Linnell introduced Samuel Palmer to Blake in 1824, having already encouraged Palmer, since meeting him in 1822, to study early Renaissance art and to make intensive studies from nature. Linnell and Palmer became close friends, and Linnell made several visits to Palmer’s house in Shoreham, Kent. He has often been blamed for Palmer’s move away from visionary landscape, but in the 1820s he was a fruitful influence on Palmer, and the two men shared many of the same ideals, including a belief that landscape painting could be a form of religious art. From the time of Palmer’s marriage to Linnell’s daughter Hannah in 1837 the relationship deteriorated, owing mainly to political and religious differences (Linnell was a radical Nonconformist, Palmer a High Church Tory) and as Linnell became more extreme in his views and eccentric in his habits.','England','John','Linnell',1792,1882,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Linnell',1),(89,'Swedish painter and designer. HildingLinnqvist studied at the Konsthögskola in Stockholm from 1910 to 1912 and then became influenced by Edvard Munch and Ernst Josephson, as shown by Self Portrait (1913; Göteborg, Kunstmuseum), executed in swift, loose brushstrokes. At the same time he experimented with a type of Cubism, as in the angular, stylised Mountain Landscape, which was influenced by the work of André Lhote. In 1917 he painted a mural for the TekniskaHögskola in Stockholm and the same year was a founder member of a Swedish painters’ group that included Victor Axelson, Alf Munthe, FritiofScüldt and Axel Nilsson, which was active until 1923. From 1920 to 1923 he travelled in Italy, England and France. Having been influenced from the 1910s by the Swedish folk art tradition, he developed a naïve painting style, as in Market Scene: Small French Town (Chinon) (1921-5; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet). In 1928 he painted murals for the Stadsbibliotek in Stockholm and in the same period visited Spain and Morocco. In 1934 he became a member of Färgoch Form (Colour and Form), an association of artists born out of the economic crisis of the 1930s.\n\nDuring the 1930s Linnqvist became influenced by the work of Paul Cézanne. His painting lost its earlier naïve style and was now executed in firm, broad brushstrokes, as in Chapel in the Wilderness: Scene from Greece (1938; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet). He was a professor at the Konsthögskola in 1939-41 and in 1946-7 he travelled in Egypt, producing such brightly coloured works as Pasha’a Island. In 1948 he executed a fresco for Sofia Church in Stockholm and in 1956 designed the decor for a performance of Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte at the KungligaTeatern in Stockholm. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he collaborated with the Aubusson firm in designing various tapestries, such as the Dream of Disa (1959) for NytorpsskolanSkola in Stockholm. His paintings of the 1950s and 1960s were strongly outlined and firmly brushed, as in Villa Entrance at Gardasjön (1968; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet), showing an increasing debt to Cézanne. He continued painting and executing decorative commissions; later works include the watercolour Gardone. In 1982 he established the HildingLinnqvist Foundation.

Born Chaim Jacob Lipchitz to a Jewish building contractor in Druskininkai, Lithuania, which was then within the Russian Empire. At first, under the influence of his father, he studied engineering, but soon after, supported by his mother, Lipchitz moved to Paris (1909) to study at the École des Beaux-Arts and the Académie Julian.It was there, in the artistic communities of Montmartre and Montparnasse, that he joined a group of artists that included Juan Gris and Pablo Picasso as well as where his friend, Amedeo Modigliani, painted Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz.Living in this environment, Lipchitz soon began to create Cubist sculpture. In 1912 he exhibited at the Salon de la SociétéNationale des Beaux-Arts and the Salon d’Automne with his first solo show held at Léonce Rosenberg’s GalerieL’EffortModerne in Paris in 1920. In 1922 he was commissioned by the Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pennsylvania to execute five bas-reliefs.\n\nConceived 11 years after Lipchitz’s arrival in Paris from Vilna, this sculpture is a perfect example of the artist’s exploration of Cubism in a three-dimensional medium. He referred to this creative approach in his autobiography: ‘One of the first sculptures made in 1919 was the Arlequinàl’Accordeon. It reflects my interest in 18th century paintings, particularly that of Watteau… The Pierrots and harlequins were part of my general vocabulary, characters taken from the Commedia dell’Arte, particularly popular in the 18th century.

René Magritte’s family moved to France in 1910 and only two years later his mother drowned herself in the River Sambre, close to the Belgium border. At 17 he painted his first pictures, influenced by his enthusiasm for detective films and the bizarre paintings of James Ensor. He studied at the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Brussels from 1916 to 1918, associating with the Belgian avant-garde while admiring the Futurists and the Italian metaphysical painter Giorgio de Chirico. In 1921 Matisse completed his military service in the Belgium infantry. \n\nAfter experimenting with abstraction, he painted The Threatened Assassin (1927; New York, MoMA) – the first of his ‘snapshots of the impossible’, in which he exploited the dislocation between image and reality. His disturbing, evocative images, thinly painted with meticulous attention to naturalistic detail, explore the poetic reality behind the appearances of objects by setting them in bizarre juxtapositions. His titles deliberately relate obliquely, if at all, to the apparent situations, thus adding an enigmatic intellectual element, frequently witty, to the imaginative paradoxes he creates.\n\nMagritte moved to Paris in 1927, becoming closely involved with the newly formed Surrealist group, led by André Breton, and including Salvador Dalí, the poet Paul Éluard, and film maker Luis Buñuel. He returned to Brussels in 1930. In 1947-8 he has his first solo exhibition of oil paintings and gouaches at Galerie du Faubourg, Paris. Magritte had enjoyed considerable recognition by virtue of his participation in Surrealist group exhibitions but he became internationally famous only after signing a contract in 1948 with Alexandre Iolas, the New York dealer who remained his agent until his death.\n\nHe produced several privately commissioned portraits and murals, including a 360-degree eight-panelled mural, The Enchanted Domain, painted from his designs at Knokke Casino, Belgium (1953), and Les Barricades Mystérieusesin for the Brussels Palais des Congrès (1961). From 1956 he also made a number of brief and often comical Surrealist films, using friends as directors and actors. In 1967 he produced a series of wax sculptures based on his paintings; eight of these, including Madame Récamier (Paris, Pompidou), were cast in bronze after his death. Magritte’s critical and popular reputation alike continued to grow during and after the 1960s, exerting a strong influence particularly on Pop Art and conceptual art. He had a retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1965.\n\nIn May 2009 the Magritte Museum, dedicated to the works of this Surrealist artist, opened to the public in Brussels.','Belgium','René','Magritte',1898,1967,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rene_Magritte',1),(92,'Italian sculptor. Born in Pistoia, Italy, Marino Marini attended the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence in 1917. Although he never abandoned painting, Marini devoted himself primarily to sculpture from about 1922. From this time his work was influenced by Etruscan art and the sculpture of Arturo Martini. Marini succeeded Martini as Professor at the Scuola d’Arte di Villa Reale in Monza, near Milan, in 1929, a position he retained until 1940.During this period, Marini travelled frequently to Paris, where he associated with Massimo Campigli, Giorgio de Chirico, Alberto Magnelli and Filippo Tibertelli de Pisis. In 1936 he moved to Tenero-Locarno, in Ticino Canton, Switzerland; during the following few years the artist often visited Zürich and Basel, where he became a friend of Alberto Giacometti, Germaine Richier, and Fritz Wotruba. In 1936, he received the Prize of the Quadriennale of Rome.\nRetrospectives of Marini’s work took place at the Kunsthaus Zürich in 1962 and at the Palazzo Venezia in Rome in 1966. His paintings were exhibited for the first time at Toninelli Arte Moderna in Milan in 1963-4.

Johan Fredrik Martin was born 8 June 1755, the brother of Swedish genre, history and landscape painter, Elias Martin.After his mother died,Johan Fredrik was sent to England to live with his uncle in 1770 where he trained as a printmaker, first under graphic artists William Woollett and Francesco Bartolozziand then under the tutelage of his elder brother. Elias, who became a member of the Royal Academy in Britain and Sweden,was instrumental in teachinghis younger brother many of the landscape devices and techniques Johan Fredrik was to use in his printmaking career. Conversely, Johan Fredrik went on to translate many of his older sibling’s works into prints, from landscapes to genre scenes and mythological subjects. \n\nAfter 1785,Johan Fredrik set out on his own and began interpreting the work of artists such as Pehr Hillström into prints as well as producing works in his own right. His most famous body of work, started in 1782, was a suite of Svenska Vuer (Swedish views), such as the three examples shown here, for which he travelled the whole country. Containing 46 plates in total and published between 1805-12, they exhibit his careful draughtsmanship and meticulous line engraving technique, as well as his compositional prowess and skill at gentle colouration, whether in watercolour or aquatint.\n\nMartin was technically highly skilled and worked using a variety of graphic techniques, particularly with stipple engraving, etching and aquatint. He was also a very talented portrait engraver, but it is for his association with his brother Elias and their anglophile influence on subsequent Swedish artists that he will be remembered. Martin is represented in the Swedish Nationalmuseum’ the Nordiska Museet and the Kungliga Biblioteket in Stockholm and many other public collections and institutions around the world, including the British Museum and the Wellcome Collection in London.','Sweden','Johan Fredrik','Martin',1755,1816,1,'',1),(94,'French painter, draughtsman, printmaker, sculptor. Henri Matisse is widely regarded as one of the two greatest artists of the 20th century, alongside his great contemporary and rival, Pablo Picasso. Matisse, noble and serious by nature, demonstrated an almost ruthless dedication to work and progressive development. Born at Le Cateau-Cambrésis in northern France, he was originally a student of law in Paris but enrolled at the Académie Julian in 1891 (under the tutelage ofWilliam-Adolphe Bouguereau) and the École des Beaux-Arts (under Gustave Moreau) in 1892, staying there until 1896. Fellow students included Henri Manguin, Albert Marquet and Georges Rouault. He was elected associate of the Société Nationale in 1896 after selling a painting to the nation from among the four he exhibited at the Salon du Champ de Mars, Paris. Influenced in tone and colour by Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Matisse now experienced the Impressionists’ work and visited London, on Camille Pissarro’s advice, to look at Joseph Mallord William Turner; this lead him to adopt a brighter palette and make colour experiments which freed colour from association or description. Paul Signac bought his Luxe, Calme et Volupté (Paris, Musée d’Orsay) from the 1905 Salon des Indépendants. At the Salon d’Automne of that year, he and his friends Marquet, Manguin, André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck made a sensational impact and were thereafter called Fauves. Michael, Leo, and Gertrude Stein began to collect his work, Leo buying Le Bonheur de Vivre (Merion, Philadelphia, Barnes Foundation) from the 1906 Indépendants.*\n\nThe quest for integrity of form when applying colour at its most intense led to the abandonment of conventional spatial devices, yet, while achieving great expressive power, Matisse turned away from Expressionism, seeking ‘balance, purity and moderation’. Another stated aim, to bring comfort and express joy, was realised in his deployment of pure colour and increasingly abstract compositions, forming a powerful mode of decorative painting. In sculpture, printmaking, illustration and drawing, he invented and demonstrated new, influential forms. \n\n* The American Stein family became very important art collectors purportedly starting their collection in 1904 with 8,000 francs. By early 1906, Leo and Gertrude Stein’s house at 27 rue de Fleurus, Parishad many paintings by Pierre Bonnard, Pablo Picasso, Paul Cézanne, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Honoré Daumier, Henri Matisse and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. In 1933, Gertrude Stein published the memoirs of her Paris years titled The Autobiography of Alice B.

Born in Rio de Janeiro, Beatriz Milhazesattended the Curso de Comunicacao Social in Facha from 1978-81 and graduated from the School of Visual Arts in Parque Lage, Brazil, in 1982. Since she first began exhibiting her work in 1983, Milhazes has been exhibited extensively throughout Brazil, Europe, North America and Australia in solo and group exhibitions. \nHer paintings are cascading swirls of colour caught in a vortex of elegant circles, which often burst on the surface like exotic blossoms, floral emblems or rosettes. Indeed, the botanical gardens near her studio are a constant source of inspiration, as is the hustle and bustle of Rio life, although there is more to her works than a carnivalesque festival of colour. Milhazes, whose feminist point of view is evident in her odes to traditionalacts of laborious women\'s work, such as lace-making, beadwork, jewellery and decorative patterns, also references the reality of Brazil as a neo-colonial country – her works serving as a meeting point between European and South American culture. \n\nBeatriz Milhazes’stechnique is novel in that the canvases are produced by a combination of piecemeal monoprints and collage, creating a relatively slick surface with tactile qualities as well as fabulous patterns of colour. After applying a flat single tone for ground to the canvas, Milhazes then paints her motifs onto clear pieces of plastic. These are then pressed on to the canvas in an approximation of the appliqué technique, the intricate dried paint ‘skin’ designs and painterly gesturesaccumulating in layers and pictorial richness.\n\nNot only do Milhazes’sflowery, filigreed, chevronsymbols and disc-like elements combine history, folk art, Pop Art, wildlife and nature, they also lend themselves to the graphic arts and to printmaking. Over the past 15 years Milhazes has been working on a series of screen and woodblock prints with Durham Press in Pennsylvania, of which these four food-inspired pieces, Açúcar, Canela, Pimeta Vermelha and Sal are all examples from 2009. These editions offer a subtle and fascinating evolution of form, colour and optical rhythm, encompassing the European Modernism of Henri Matisse and Sonia Delaunay, as well asthe Brazilian Tropicália movement. \n\nInfluenced by her native land of Brazil, Beatriz Milhazes’s vibrant and bold use of colour and patterns create work that is as much playful, free and psychedelic, as it is geometric, organised and rhythmic.

Joan Miró was born and studied in Barcelona, where he met Pablo Picasso. Miró was 18 before he decided to devote himself to painting, having been initially struck by the primitive frescoes on the walls of local Romanesque churches and then, at art school, by the experiments of the European avant-garde. His early works, from around 1914, were painted in strong, hot colours and show some Cubist influence. In 1920 he moved to Paris and in 1925 took part in the First Surrealist Exhibition in the Galerie Pierre. However, while recognised as a distinguished member of the Surrealist group and sharing their interest in the unconscious, Miró retained his independence and his style remained distinctive. André Breton went as far as describing Miró as ‘probably the most Surrealist of us’, although his paintings were deemed ‘childlike’ and ‘innocent’.Miró ignored the hostility between Surrealism and general abstraction, instead exploiting the tensions between them in delicate, tautly poised compositions which expressed the energies of life through rhythmically organised amoeboid forms, withcosmic, botanical, geometric or abstract lines floating against celestial blue, sandy yellow or earth brown backgrounds.\n\nIn the 1920s, Miró’s paintings moved closer to pure drawing, which is perhaps why he would so frequently turn to lithography and other methods of printmaking throughout his career. ‘I have noticed that the ones that have been painted touch the spirit less directly than the ones that are simply drawn (or that use a minimum of colour),’ he wrote in 1924, adding, ‘There is no doubt that my canvases that are simply drawn, with a few dots of colour, a rainbow, are more profoundly moving.’\n\nBut he was still not satisfied. In 1928 he declared, ‘I want to murder painting.’ And for the next two years he literally turned against paint, adding sandpaper, tar paper, feathers, wire, string, nails and other ordinary objects to his canvases as collages. And even when he returned to painting in 1930, he often painted black and red shapes on sandpaper, with disturbing effect. ‘I personally don\'t know where we are heading,’ Miró told a Spanish journalist in 1931. ‘The only thing that’s clear to me is that I intend to destroy, destroy everything that exists in painting. I have utter contempt for painting. The only thing that interests me is the spirit itself, and I only use the customary artists’ tools – brushes, canvas and paint – in order to get the best effects. I’m only interested in anonymous art, the kind that springs from the collective unconscious.’\n\nMiró returned to Spain in 1940 and began making ceramics, resulting in a number of public commissions. The fullness of his art emerged during this period, with its graphic style and rounded forms by which colour masses are contrasted with line drawing and in which characters are almost completely abstract. Sometimes humorous, sometimes alarming, and always original and suggestive, much of Miró’s later work became increasingly abstract, his primitive glyphs, wandering lines and inconclusive forms becoming ever-more mystical. Miró described them as dream paintings or hallucinatory landscapes.\n\nMiró’s work underwent a profound change in 1960, when he began to use black both to outline shapes and to fill them in. His later work is dramatic, even tragic, with colour often suppressed or counteracted by the weight accorded to black. His faith in abstraction was expressed during this period with particular eloquence in large canvases in which broad strokes of colour are set against sensuously painted backgrounds, as in his paintings of the mid-1920s; the simplicity of gesture and boldness of scale and handling make these among his most impressive and influential later works. \n\nThe large retrospectives devoted to Miró in his old age in cities such as New York (1972), London (1972), Saint-Paul-de-Vence (1973) and Paris (1974) were a good indication of the international acclaim that had grown steadily over the previous half century; further major retrospectives took place posthumously. Political changes in his native country led, in 1978, to the first full exhibition of his painting and graphic work, at the Museo Español de Arte Contemporáneo in Madrid. The Fundació Joan Miró was inaugurated in Barcelona in 1975 in a building designed by his friend Josep Lluís Sert, housing a large number of paintings, drawings, sculptures and prints donated by the artist. When Miró died,aged 90 at his home in Majorca, he had not only become one of the greatest Spanish artists of all timebut perhaps the last surviving pioneer of 20th century Modernist painting.','Spain','Joan','Miró',1893,1983,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Miro',1),(97,'English sculptor and draughtsman. One of most important British artists of the 20th century, Moore was one of eight children by a Yorkshire coal-mining engineer and was born in Castleford. By the time he went to study at Leeds School of Art in 1919, he had already seen active service in World War I – initially he was the youngest man in his regiment – and had spent three months in a military hospital after having been gassed. In 1921 he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art, London, where, in addition to his studies, he spent much of his time at the British Museum. An enthusiastic Modernist, Moore kept in touch with European developments and admired the work of the British sculptors Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Eric Gill. \n\nFrom 1925 until 1931 he taught at the Royal College of Art. In 1928 he received his first commission, a relief for the London Underground Headquarters, which proved controversial because of its primitivism. His work of this period, like the Reclining Figure (1929; Leeds, Art Gallery) shows the influence of Epstein and primitive Mayan art. During the 1930s Moore was associated with the Hampstead artists, particularly Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth, whom he joined in the 7 & 5 Society in 1930 and Unit One in 1933, and moved to the Chelsea School of Art (1932-9) which he found more progressive than the Royal College. The abstract biomorphic carvings of this period are among his most innovative works and, in common with Hepworth, he also explored the potential of the pierced form, a stylistic device which was to bring him notoriety in the 1930s.\n\nDuring World War II Moore made the works for which he is perhaps most admired, the so-called ‘shelter drawings’. In his capacity as one of the London Home Guard, Moore haunted the subterranean caves – underground stations, factory basements – that had become the refuge for so many homeless during the Blitz. Back in the studio, he personalised his reactions in ink and chalk and watercolour, producing some of the finest depictions of the material cruelties of war since Francisco Goya.In the 1940s he also established an international reputation that was confirmed by the award of the International Sculpture Prize at the Venice Biennale of 1948. During the 1950s monumental reclining female figures, of varying degrees of abstraction, dominated his work, culminating in the Reclining Figure carved for the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) building, Paris, in 1957. He also produced increasing numbers of modelled and cast figures and through the 1960s experimented with sculptures in several parts, creating tension between the individual elements. Determinedly humanist, even at his most abstract, Moore’s forms evolved to chart human awareness and anxieties in a changing world. Vitality was the quality in sculpture that for him defined success or failure, a force unrelated to traditional concepts of beauty, revealed through the energy contained within the work.\n\nThe reclining figure was a constant source of inspiration for Moore, one which proved to be resilient precisely because its universal appeal allowed for reinterpretation and reappropriation. As early as 1924 Moore won a six-month travelling scholarship which he spent in northern Italy studying the great works of Michelangelo, Giotto di Bondone, Giovanni Pisano and several other Old Masters. It was during this period that he also visited Paris to take advantage of the timedsketching classes at the Académie Colarossi, and to draw, in the Trocadero, a plaster cast of a Toltec-Maya sculptural form, the Chac Mool, previously seen in book illustrations. The reclining figure was to have a profound effect upon Moore’s work, becoming the primary motif of his sculpture. \n\nThree Piece Reclining Figure No.2: Bridge Propis one of Moore’s most technically sophisticated and complex treatments of the theme. Moore himself explained the development of the divided forms as follows: ‘I did the first one in two pieces almost without intending to. The words Bridge and Prop came about because if one looks at the sculpture, with its base at eye level, then it makes a series of arches, or bridges (it reminded me while doing it of the views underneath Waterloo Bridge from the Embankment, which I often pass when taking a taxi from Liverpool Street Station to the West End). Prop applies to the arm that props up the head and shoulder part against the middle piece – and the two words just got joined together, and became Bridge-Prop.’\n\n\nThe last three decades of Moore’s life continued in a similar vein. Several major retrospectives took place around the worldand by the end of the 1970s, there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work. The number of commissions continued to increase; he completed Knife Edge Two Piecein 1962 for College Green near the Houses of Parliament in London.\n\nAs his wealth grew, Moore began to worry about his legacy. With the help of his daughter Mary, he set up the Henry Moore Trust in 1972, with a view to protecting his estate from death duties. By 1977 he established the Henry Moore Foundation as a registered charity with his wife Irina and Mary as trustees. The Foundation was established to encourage the public appreciation of the visual arts and especially the works of Moore. It now runs his house and estate at Perry Green, with a gallery, sculpture park and studios. Moore died on 31 August 1986, at the age of 88, in his home in Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, where his body is interred in Perry Green churchyard.','England','Henry','Moore',1898,1986,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Moore',1),(98,'British textile manufacturer and abstract painter. Alistair Morton studied at Edinburgh University and Balliol College, Oxford. In 1928 James Morton (the artist’s father) founded the Edinburgh Weavers as a research unit to discover how textiles could be produced in keeping with developments in contemporary architecture. In 1930, for economic reasons, the workshop merged with Morton Sundour’s main weaving factory in Carlisle, but retained its individual identity which continued through to when Morton was appointed Artistic Director in 1932. In October 1937 Morton launched the Constructivist Fabrics range in New Bond Street with designs by Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, Eileen Holding, Winifred Dacre (Nicholson) and Ashley Havinden. \n\nMorton’s work as artist is less well known than his output as an avant-garde textile producer. While living in Carlisle, he began a life-long friendship with Ben and Winifred Nicholson in the early 1930s, becoming a substantial benefactor to them during the formative years of Abstract Constructivism. He started to paint in 1936, contributing to Circle: International Survey of Constructivist Art, edited by Ben Nicholson and Naum Gabo and exhibited at the Minto House Exhibition of Modern Art in May 1937. In it Nicholson wrote: ‘The designs I made for Edinburgh Weavers were entirely brought about by him [Alistair Morton],’ but he also personally wrote to Morton in 1940 about his paintings saying: ‘I expect the new oil abstracts are very good. It is the sustained tension in these more serious works that is really satisfying.’ Hepworth meanwhile wrote to Morton about his use of black: ‘I like the ones with black and primary colours side by side – very virile and exciting balance.’\n\nNicholson and Hepworth were without doubt great influences on Morton as an artist. However, the use of form and colour in this collection of paintings and drawings show how, as an Abstract Constructivist, Morton, far from being an imitator, stands distinct and unique, rightly gaining the respect both publicly and privately of these two great artists.','England','Alastair','Morton',1910,1963,1,'',1),(99,'Shortly after being released from prison, Mouly, along with fellow artists Édouard Pignon, rented the Boulogne studio of famed modernist sculptor Jacques Lipchitz.

Mouly’s first one-person exhibition was held in 1949 at the Libraire Bergamasque and he was awarded the Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et Lettres in 1957.\n\nMouly’s style was influenced by the Cubism of Pablo Picasso and particularly the deep, bold colours typically used in Henri Matisse’s Fauvist works. Mouly closely studied the master colourist, and used that knowledge and appreciation to create his harmonious and balanced compositions with juxtaposed elements of warm and cool colours in heavy blocks. His female forms, harbour scenes and still lifes are created with a fluid brushstroke and organic lines and shapes. Beginning in the mid-1950s, Mouly created many lithographs, later winning the Premier Prix de Lithographie in 1973. He was a founder member of Groupe 109 and, as one of the young painters of the Paris School, he redefined his work according to strictly Post-Cubist rules.\n\nMouly has exhibited all over the world and currently has paintings hanging in the Musée Nationale d’Art Moderne, Paris, the Musée d’Art et d’Histoire(Geneva) and the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.

Matei Negreanu was born in Bucharest, Romania, in 1941, to a bourgeois mother and peasant-turned-industrialist father, the latter who died prematurely of a brutal accident. Negreanu studied Fine Arts at the Grigorescu Institute of Bucharest. He later focused his studies on glasswork although he was practised in the art of metalwork, industrial design and painting. The Romanian art scene felt constrained and controlled under the dictactorship of Nicolae Ceausescu, so that after the death of his mother, Negreanu radically changed his life by taking a train to Paris. He was 40. ‘Upon my arrival in Paris in 1981, I walked home,’ Negreanu explains. ‘My soul is still in Romania, but I do not understand the emigrants who weep while their roots are able to return home.’\n\nInitially based in the Sologne region of France, Negreanu immediately set to work creating glass sculptures; he was soon noticed by the French community of creative glass, including Gallerie Capazza, Nançay.

In 1989 he exhibited at the Clara Scremini Gallery, Paris, which introduced his work, now incorporating lead, to international collectors of contemporary art. He travelled to many cities worldwide, including Amsterdam, Frankfurt, New York, Chicago, Toronto, Sapporo, Tokyo and Mexico. \n\nIn 1995 he participated in Colours and Transparency (Sèvres and Dunkirk) and a year later exhibited at Properties at the Clara Scremini Gallery, and Spheres at Strasbourg’s Contemporary Art Fair. His works can be found in larges public collections including the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris, Bordeaux, Athens, Bucharest and Lausanne, the Corning Museum of Glass, New York and the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh. Currently, Negreanu works regularly with mixed media in which the glass is combined with other textures: black-lacquered wood, red velvet and, in this instance, gold leaf. Each year, he presents his recent works at the prestigious contemporary glass fair, Verriales, hosted by the International Gallery of Glass, Biot, Alpes-Maritimes.','France','Matei','Negreanu',1941,-1,1,'',1),(101,'English artist. Ben Nicholson was born in Denham, Buckinghamshire, and was the son of the artists William Nicholson and Mabel Pryde. He studied at the Slade School of Art, 1910-1. He spent 1912-4 in France and Italy, and was in the United States in 1917-8. He married the artist Winifred Roberts in 1920. Over the next three years they spent winters in Lugano, Switzerland, and then divided their time between London and Cumberland. In 1931, Nicholson’s relationship with the sculptor Barbara Hepworth resulted in the breakdown of his marriage to Winifred. He and Hepworth married in 1938 and divorced in 1951. Nicholson lived in London from 1932-9, making several trips to Paris in 1932-3, visiting the studios of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Hans Arp, Constantin Brancusi and Piet Mondrian. From 1939-58 he lived and worked in Cornwall, before moving to Switzerland. He returned to London in 1974.\n\nNicholson’s earliestpaintingswerestill lifesinfluenced by those of his father. In the 1920s he began paintingfigurativeandabstractworks inspired byPost-ImpressionismandCubism. He produced his first geometric and abstractreliefsin 1933. He first exhibited in 1919 at the Grosvenor Gallery and Grafton Galleries in London. His first one-man show was held at the Twenty-one Gallery, London, in 1924. From 1924-35 he was a member of the7 & 5 Society, and in 1933 he joinedUnit One, founded by Paul Nash. In 1937 Nicholson, Naum Gabo and the architect Leslie Martin editedCircle: International Survey of Constructive Art.Circleidentified Nicholson with a group of like-minded artists and architects who wanted to apply Constructivist principles to public and private art, advocating mathematical precision, clean lines and an absence of ornament.\n\nIn 1952 Nicholson won first prize at the Carnegie International, Pittsburgh, then the Ulissi Prize with a retrospective exhibition at the Venice Biennale two years later, prompting invitations for a European tour of the show.In 1955, by the time the exhibition had reached London’s Tate, Nicholson had won the Governor of Tokyo’s Award, as well as that of the Belgian Art Critics in Paris. In 1956 he won the first Guggenheim International Award. The next year he took first prize at the São Paulo Biennial as the best non-Brazilian painter. He received the Order of Merit in 1968. Numerous other exhibitions of his work have been held, including retrospectives in Kunsthalle, Berne in 1961, Museum of Fine Arts, Dallas in 1964, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo in 1978, and the Tate in 1993-4. Helped by wide international exposure in British Council tours during the 1940s and 1950s and by the championing of the writer Herbert Read, Nicholson’s work came to be seen, along with that of Henry Moore, as the quintessence of British Modernism.','England','Ben','Nicholson',1894,1982,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Nicholson',1),(102,'Swedish painter. Often regarded as one of Sweden’s most prominent female artists, Vera Nilsson was born in Jönköping in 1888, studied at the Technical School in Stockholm (1906-9), before attending the School of Fine Art in Gothenburg under Carl Wilhelmson in 1910. During 1911-2 Nilsson lived in Paris, studying Cubism under Henri Le Fauconnier at the Académie de la Palette. \n\nHer debut exhibition of drawings and paintings, shared with Mollie Faustman, was held in 1917 in Copenhagen. By 1922 she was the only female artist included in Phalanx, a group of 17 Swedish artists made up of former pupils of Henri Matisse, which included Leander Engrström the Elder. \n\nAs can be seen in By på Öland, by 1930, Nilsson was combining bold brushstrokes with intense Expressionist colours for her landscapes, revealing perhaps an influence of the Göteborg Colourists, active in Sweden’s west coast in the 1920s. Öland was a particular inspiration for her landscape studies as Nilsson spent most of her summers there. Her output also co-existed happily with the primitive colourism emanating from the influential Färg och Form group of 1932, of which she was once more the only female member. \n\nAs well as landscapes, Nilsson painted many emotionally charged figurative works, revealing a fascination with the ordinary in life, whether it was a child blowing bubbles or intensely writing a letter. \n\nNilsson was a prime advocate for getting art permanently into the Stockholm Metro, resulting in her and 11 other artists being commissioned to produce artwork for the underground. This culminated in 1957 in Nilsson’s mosaic-tiled pillar on Central station’s upper platform entitled The beat that, after all, does not disappear. In 1954 Nilsson was elected to become a member of Stockholm’s Royal Academy of Fine Arts, the first female to be asked since 1889.\n\nHer works can be found in Stockholm’s National Museum and Museum of Modern Art, the Gothenburg Art Museum, Gripsholm Castle, as well as in Hamburg.','Sweden','Vera','Nilsson',1888,1979,1,'',1),(103,'Swedish painter. In 1875 Karl Nordström went to Stockholm, where he studied at the Konstakademi and at the art school of Edvard Perséus. At the former he met the painters Richard Bergh and Nils Kreuger who became lifelong friends. He spent his formative years in France (1880-86) as a member of the Scandinavian artists’ colonies in Paris and Grez-sur-Loing. Having been attracted to Paris by the ideals of French Naturalism, he visited the Seventh Impressionist Exhibition (1882), which affected his painting of this period (e.g. The Old Bridge at Grèz, 1882; Stockholm, Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde). He spent most of his time in Grèz, dedicating himself to plein-air painting.\n\nNordström shared the radical views of his colleagues in exile and together they formed the protest movement Opponenterna. Led by the Swedish painter Ernst Josephson, they revolted against the conservatism of the Konstakademi in Stockholm and demanded its reorganisation. In 1885 Nordström and some of the opponents put on their first exhibition in Stockholm, Fran Seinens Strand (From the Banks of the Seine). In order to arrange their own exhibitions, the opponents formed the Konstnärsförbund (Artists’ Union) in 1886. For financial reasons Nordström had returned to Sweden that year. At first he tried to apply the painting techniques he had absorbed in France to northern landscapes, notably in Tjörn and then in Stockholm, where he settled with his family in 1888, but he soon developed a painting style based on the compositional principles of the Synthetists and Japanese masters, resulting in a simplification of forms and colours. He favoured views of Stockholm at dusk in blue or orange mists (e.g. View of Stockholm from Skansen, 1889). He spent the summer of 1889 on the Swedish island of Gotland. His study of the fine gradations of light resulted in a series of high quality drawings in charcoal, a medium that he was to favour throughout his career along with oils (e.g. Northern Town-wall, 1889; Visby, Säve-Salen). Such paintings as Storm Clouds (1893; Stockholm, Nationalmuseum) and Varberg Fort (1893; Stockholm, Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde) epitomise the wilderness in the barren landscapes of Tjörn and Varberg, their dark colours reflecting a melancholy mood typical of the National Romantic era. Stylistically they are based on the works of Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh, which Nordström had seen in Copenhagen.','Sweden','Karl','Nordström',1855,1923,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Nordstr%C3%B6m',1),(104,'Swedish painter. Eric Olson was born in Halmstead, Stockholm, brother to artist axel Olson. He grew up there attending the local technical college. In 1919 he had a show of his art with his cousin Axel Waldemar Lorentzon. That same summer they met the artist Gösta Adrian-Nilsson, who was extremely influential with both his painting style and theories on art. Olson and Lorentzon travelled to Paris in 1924 where they met Fernand Léger, helping in his studio together with Franciscka Clausen and Otto Carlsund. During this time Olson abandoned the style of his previous mentor and looked towards Léger for inspiration. He also adopted some of the aspects of Amédée Ozenfant’s art theories. \n\nIn 1929 Olson married Solvig Sven-Nilsson with whom he lived for periods in France and Denmark. Starting in the 1930s, he participated in exhibitions in, for example, Copenhagen, London, Paris and New York. He mostly spent his summers at the coast of Halland where he joined the Söndrumskolonin during the 1940s.

Olle Olsson-Hagalund was born the only child of Tuttan and Conny Olsson. He grew up in Hagalund, north of Stockholm, in a house with decorative woodwork framing the windows, eaves and porch. He lived here throughout his life. As a child Olsson was a loner. He often wandered by himself observing and drawing his surroundings. After school, Olsson sought employment at the National Railway Company, a job which didn’t really suit him. He later lost his job and, with a small amount of savings, registered at the Carl Wilhelmssons Painting School. He only spent a short time at the school, feeling uneasy in the company of colourful and expressive painters. He began to doubt his competence and was relieved when a lack of money forced him to leave. During the following years long periods of unemployment followed; however, he spent much of his time painting in secrecy, not showing his art to anyone. \n\nIn 1943 a department store organised a competition for young amateur painters. Olsson submitted six paintings, all of which were accepted. After positive responses from a couple of group showings it was time for Olsson’s first one-man show. The show opened in 1938 at Gallery Färg och Form in Stockholm and was a big success. The press and public were overwhelmed. The critics praised his colouristic talent and ability to bring to life the shabby suburbs in Hagalund.\n \nMore exhibitions followed in Scandinavia, including Copenhagen and Oslo, as well as in many Swedish cities. The artist was also represented at the Venice Biennale in 1942. As the years passed, Olsson chose to exhibit his work less often. He started to devote his time to scenography, spending the 1950s and 1960s collaborating as a scenographer in a number of productions at many of Stockholm’s theatres.','Sweden','Olle','Olsson-Hagalund',1904,1972,1,'',1),(106,'British conceptual painter. Born in Redhill, UK, Jonathan Parsons studied at Goldsmiths College, University of London, between 1989 and 1992. He has been working on an extended series of bright, multi-coloured grid paintings since 1995. He says of the works: ‘I am looking for a way to reduce a picture down to something like its fundamental constituents: brush marks; colours; configuration; illusion. They form a sort of generic type of picture in my practice, which encapsulates what interests me in painting: illusory pictorial depth; the flat surface; anti-composition; non-gesture. The brush marks in all of my grid paintings are – due to their implied impossibility, construction and artificial assembly – a sort of “portrait” of brush strokes. They are pictorial illusions, made with a brush. The apparent space that separates the orange and black marks in Instar, for example, implies that each successive notional layer does not lie flat over the preceding one. Therefore the picture becomes a depiction of space, which “falsifies” the flat painted stroke.’\n\nParsons’s work has been exhibited widely, being included in Charles Saatchi’s Sensation at the Royal Academy of Art, London, which then travelled to Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin and Brooklyn Museum of Art, New York (1997-9); his artwork formed part of the Hayward Gallery National Touring Exhibition’s British Art Show 5, (2000-1). Works by Parsons are held in many private collections worldwide: London, Milan, Venice, Los Angeles and New York; as well as in the following public collections: Arts Council of England Collection, UK Government Art Collection, Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery, The Jerwood Foundation, The Leverhulme Trust and London Transport Museum.\n\nHis commissions include: The Jerwood Foundation, Terminator (2010, ongoing); UK Government Art Collection, Let Me Count the Ways atthe new British Embassy, Doha, Qatar (2008); Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery, Alphanumeric Flags (2005); James Hockey Gallery, London, Babies Blue (2000); Milch, Commune (1998); Saatchi Collection, London, Achrome (1994).','England','Jonathan','Parsons',1970,-1,1,'',1),(107,'','France','Claude','Pellier',-1,-1,1,'',1),(108,'Spanish artist. Born in Málaga to María Picasso y López and José Ruiz Blasco, an art teacher and minor painter, Pablo Picasso became the most famous and influential artist of the 20th century. Picasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age. According to his mother, his first words were ‘piz, piz’, a shortening of lápiz, the Spanish word for pencil. From the age of seven, Picasso received formal artistic training from his father in figure drawing and oil painting. Ruiz was a traditional, academic artist and instructor who believed that proper training required disciplined copying of the masters, and drawing the human body from plaster casts and live models.\n\nPicasso’s father sent the young artist to Madrid’s Royal Academy of San Fernando, the country’s foremost art school. At age 16, Picasso set off for the first time on his own, but he disliked formal instruction and quit attending classes soon after enrolment. Madrid, however, held many other attractions. The Prado housed paintings by Diego Velázquez, Francisco Goya and Francisco Zurbarán. Picasso especially admired the works of El Greco; elements like the elongated limbs, arresting colours, and mystical visages are echoed in his later work.\n\nPicasso made his first trip to Paris in 1900, then the art capital of Europe. There, he met his first Parisian friend, the journalist and poet Max Jacob, who helped Picasso learn the language and its literature. Soon they shared an apartment; Max slept at night while Picasso slept during the day and worked at night. These were times of severe poverty, cold and desperation. Much of his work was burned to keep the small room warm. During the first five months of 1901, Picasso lived in Madrid, where he and his anarchist friend Francisco de Asís Soler founded the magazine Arte Joven (Young Art), which published five issues. Soler solicited articles and Picasso illustrated the journal, mostly contributing grim cartoons depicting and sympathising with the state of the poor. The first issue was published on 31 March 1901, by which time the artist had started to sign his work simply Picasso.\n\nBy 1905, Picasso became a favourite of the American art collectors Leo and Gertrude Stein. Gertrude Stein became Picasso’s principal patron, acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal Salon at her home in Paris. At one of her gatherings in 1905, Picasso met Henri Matisse, who was to become a lifelong friend and rival.\n\nIn 1907 Picasso joined an art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler. Kahnweiler was a German art historian and art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20thcentury. He was among the first champions of Picasso, Georges Braque and the Cubism that they jointly developed. Kahnweiler promoted burgeoning artists such as André Derain, Kees van Dongen, Fernand Léger, Juan Gris, Maurice de Vlaminck and several others who had come from all over the globe to live and work in Montparnasse at the time.\n\nIn the early 20thcentury, Picasso divided his time between Barcelona and Paris. In 1904, in the middle of a storm, he met Fernande Olivier, a bohemian artist who became his mistress. Olivier appears in many of his Rose period paintings. After acquiring some fame and fortune, Picasso left Olivier for Marcelle Humbert, whom he called Eva Gouel. Picasso included declarations of his love for Eva in many Cubist works. Picasso was devastated by her premature death from illness at the age of 30 in 1915.\n\nAfter World War I, Picasso made a number of important relationships with figures associated with Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. Among his friends during this period were Jean Cocteau, Jean Hugo, Juan Gris and others. In the summer of 1918, Picasso married Olga Khokhlova, a ballerina with Diaghilev’s troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Parade, in Rome. During the same period that Picasso collaborated with Diaghilev’s troupe, he and Igor Stravinsky collaborated on Pulcinella in 1920. Picasso took the opportunity to make several drawings of the composer.\n\nIn 1927 Picasso met 17-year-old Marie-Thérèse Walter and began a secret affair with her. Throughout his life Picasso maintained a number of mistresses in addition to his wife or primary partner. Picasso was married twice, his first wife being Khokhlova and towards the end of his life he married Jacqueline Roque who worked at the Madoura pottery where Picasso’s ceramic works were made.He had four children, Paulo with Khokhlova, Maya with Marie-Thérèse Walter and Claude and Paloma with the painterFrançoiseGilot. Claude runs the Picasso Administration in Paris and Paloma is known for her jewellery designs for Tiffany and her perfumes. \n\nIn 1944, after the liberation of Paris, Picasso, then 63-years old, began to come to terms with his advancing age and his waning attraction to young women. Many paintings, ink drawings and prints have as their theme an old, grotesque dwarf as the doting lover of a beautiful young model. \n\nAlthough the 20thcentury’s most prodigious painter lived most of his phenomenally productive life in France, and in particular, Paris, he never ceased being Spanish, and in particular, Catalan. The bullfight contained for him all the drama, pageantry and mythology of life, and he turned the theme via the alchemy of his brush into a stylised iconography, as persistent as a dream.\n\nPicasso was an international celebrity, with often as much interest in his personal life as in his art. Intellectually restless and relentlessly inventive, his brilliant draughtsmanship underpinned all that he undertook and his creative mastery extended all the technical processes he employed. He desired to be ‘Le peintre de la vie moderne’ and once he had achieved the reputation of being the leading painter of his age, he jealously and competitively guarded it.His capacity to transfigure the realities of the visual world around him into revolutionary new forms required a refined eye, an extraordinary imagination and great daring; he was not found wanting. Nor was he a stranger to the shock tactic; a taste for the barbaric accompanied the wit, the vitality and the dynamism. To much of his contemporary audience his sudden changes in direction and style seemed wilful and bewildering, yet, with time and an overview, it is possible to recognise a logic in the rapid, developmental achievements of his inventions, where new forms were created to solve new problems, and to admire his ability to inform all his works, great and small, with the originality and grandeur of his genius.\n\nFrom 1946 Picasso lived mainly in the south of France at Antibes, Vallauris, and from 1958 near Aix-en-Provence.Picasso had lived in Mougins, a few miles from Cannes, from 1936-9 with Dora Maar.A few decades later Picasso bought Mas Notre-Dame-de-Vie,a house on the outskirts of Mougins, and gave it to Jacqueline Roque for a wedding present. They lived there from 1961 until his death in 1973.\nPicasso first met Ilya Ehrenburg, one of the most important and controversial Russian cultural figures of the 20th century, on the eve of the First World War, after the latter had been forced to flee Tsarist Russia in order to avoid imprisonment because of his involvement in the Bolshevik underground. Their friendship and collaboration was to last more than 50 years, until Ehrenburg’s death in 1967.\n\nPicasso never abandoned completely the physical world as a source for his inspiration but he did abjure the artistic conventions of the traditions he inherited, and created a conceptual form of art rather than recording the appearance of a perceived world, where images could be subjected to objective criteria in their evaluation. He released works of art from being representations of things seen and gave each work independence in its own reality, requiring the spectator, in their subjective response, to come to terms with newly devised forms conceived to express the artists’ own subjective experience. Much of the history of 20th-century art is a record of this challenge. Picasso died on 8 April 1973 in Mougins, France, while he and his wife Jacqueline entertained friends for dinner. His final words were, ‘Drink to me, drink to my health, you know I can’t drink any more.’','Spain','Pablo','Picasso',1881,1973,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_picasso',1),(109,'French painter and printmaker. Camille Pissarro was born to a Jewish family of French, originally Portuguese, descent. His artistic inclinations first surfaced while he was a schoolboy at Passy, near Paris, but he remained essentially self-taught.Pissarro’s acquaintance around 1850 with a Danish artist, Fritz Melbye, convinced him of his true vocation and, between 1852 and 1854, they travelled together to Venezuela, establishing a studio in Caracas.  \n\nPissarro arrived in Paris in early October 1855.Although he kept a studio in Paris, he preferred to live in more rural areas, such as Pontoise, La Roche-Guyon and Louveciennes, where the present picture was painted.Pissarro was the only painter to exhibit in all eight of the Impressionist exhibitions, held between 1874 and 1886, and he is often regarded as the ‘father’ of the movement. \n\nIn 1885 Pissarro was introduced to Paul Signac and Georges Seurat and the Neo-Impressionists and he aligned himself with a younger generation of artists, including Vincent van Gogh.In his later years, Pissarro adopted a radical political stance and, by the 1890s,he was a committed supporter of anarchism.\n\nThe present painting is a wonderful example of one of the most loved subjects of Impressionism, the winter landscape and the ‘effets de neige’.These Impressionist snowscapes ‘go to the heart of one of the central issues of Impressionism, a dedication to painting specific effects of weather and light’ (Eliza E. Rathbone, Impressionists in Winter, Effets de Neige, exhibition catalogue, Washington D.C., The Phillips Collection, 1998-9, p. 9).Thewhite snow provides a counterpoint to the accents of colour in the landscape and the whole scene offers a snapshot of muffled conversations as a couple make their way home, snow crunching underfoot. \n\nThis winter landscape is likely to have been painted in the winter of 1869-70.In 1870 Pissarro was forced to move to London in order to avoid the dangers of the Franco-Prussian War and, when he returned in 1871, he discovered that many of his canvases at Louveciennes had been destroyed.The rarity of Pissarro’s works from this period makes this painting an important historical and artistic document of the early Impressionist style.','France','Camille','Pissarro',1830,1903,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Pissarro',1),(110,'English sculptor and photographer. Derick Pobell was born in Munich in 1960 but between 1969 and 1971 he lived in Ithaca, New York, where his father was a physicist at Cornell University. During his time at the Academy for Photography in Munich (1982-4) he worked as a freelance assistant, travelling extensively during the vacations. Pobell began his professional photographic career working mainly for advertising agencies, including the commercial campaigns for major German car companies (BMW, Mercedes, Audi), banks (Deutsche Bank, HypoVereinsbank), eyeware (Rodenstock, Paloma Picasso), as well as brewery and computer companies (1984-2002). His photography has featured in Men’s Vogue, Stern and, unusually for a German photographer, in Interview, the magazine founded by Andy Warhol. \nPobell’s first kinetic sculpture was created in 1990: ‘Making mobiles was just a hobby. But more and more people who saw them at my place wanted to buy them which encouraged me to put more emphasis into this work. By 2009 I felt that I had developed my own style which was worth showing to the public.’ In 2012, Pobell moved to the countryside near Berlin, where he produces only a few unique objects, individually numbered and signed, every year. The mobile in this collection has the number 1203 in its title, and signature ‘Derick’ written and incised with a thin, black magic marker. The number refers to the year it was made (2012) and that it is the third sculpture of that year.

Born in Russia, Serge Poliakoff arrived in Paris in 1923 and attended several of the Académies Libres. He moved to London in 1935 and attended the Slade School of Fine Art. His deep interest in painting techniques led him to examine Egyptian sarcophagi in the British Museum; their superimposition of colours, together with the example of Paul Cézanne and that of the Italian primitives in the Louvre, proved of great importance to him on his return to France. Among 20th-century painters he admired the purity and construction of space in the work of Juan Gris and the spirit of Paul Klee’s art. \n\nIn 1938 Poliakoff began to take an interest in abstract painting, more as a result of Otto Freundlich’s example than Wassily Kandinsky’s; but his full conversion took place through his meetings with Robert Delaunay, who in informal gatherings during this period used to explain to his painter friends his theory of simultaneous contrasts. Poliakoff’s interest in the specific properties and constructive possibilities of colour led him to produce his first abstract paintings, such as Abstract Composition (1938; artist’s collection).\n\nPoliakoff subsequently developed his exceptional gifts as a colourist, studying the material properties of colours, carrying out experiments to thicken the paint surface, and finally abandoning commercially produced paints in tubes in order to prepare his own in the manner of the Old Masters. At the same time, he superimposed layers of different colours like the Egyptians, so obtaining an inner light and intensity. In 1945 he held his first solo exhibition at the Galerie L’Esquisse in Paris and exhibited for the first time at the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles. In 1947 he was the first to be awarded the Prix Kandinsky, founded by Nina Kandinsky. Although already well established, Poliakoff achieved his mature style only in the late 1940s, for example in Composition (1948; New York, Guggenheim), by complementing his mastery of colour with a strong formal construction of the surface. He spoke of Byzantine painting as the canon by which he established an equilibrium between verticals and horizontals, between the centre and the edges of the painted surface, in paintings such as Abstract Composition (1956; London, Tate). His thoughts about art were outlined in Cahier Serge Poliakoff (1973, Saint-Gallen). Widely exhibited during the 1950s and 1960s, Poliakoff’s work has an important place in the Ecole de Paris and in post-war abstract painting. His late paintings, such as Composition in Black, Red, Yellow, White (1967; Paris, Gallery Melki), clearly demonstrate his continuing originality.','France','Serge','Poliakoff',1900,1969,-1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serge_Poliakoff',1),(112,'British sculptor. Tom Price was born in London where he continues to live and work. Price’s video work has progressively explored the way in which the head and face can be used to construct and reveal character by utilising the techniques of stop-motion animation and the visual language of portraiture. Price’s sculptures revolve around the same pivotal ideas as his videos. The figures are constructed from an emotional context, with their physical attributes appropriated from various sources, both imagined and from the real world. The figures’ scale and high level of detail places them under the close scrutiny of the viewer, which slowly reveals the qualities that remove them from their seemingly Classical context. \n\nThe complexities of facial gestures and their associated responses have generated a response within Price’s work towards the simplification of these gestures. The animated faces may become more sophisticated and structurally complex, but their movements are constantly being refined, so as to achieve the greatest effect from the smallest movement. This drive for refinement has become an obsession where, with each reduction in gesture, inflections that are present become intensified so that a simple blink or tiny head movement becomes psychologically loaded. This is essential to understanding the characters and the internal world they manifest in their states of being.','England','Tom','Price',1981,-1,1,'',1),(113,'French printmaker, draughtsman and painter. Odilon Redon started his active artistic career after the Franco-Prussin War in which he served as a soldier. He regarded this experience as the catalyst that finally produced in him a firm sense of vocation. He settled in Paris in 1868and began to participate in the artistic and intellectual life there.When the term Symbolist became current as a description of the new art and literature in 1886,Redon was considered the major Symbolist artist. His works were widely debated in Symbolist reviews in Belgium as well as France, but Redon himself was alarmed at the excesses of many of these interpretations and maintained a discreet distance from such groups. \n\nHis chief literary ally wasStéphane Mallarmé, whom he met in 1883. Their friendship was close, although their only attempt at collaboration, Redon’s lithographs (1898) for Mallarmé’s Un coup de dés, was not completed. Redon has been termed ‘the Mallarmé of painting’. The transformation of nature into dream-like images, suggesting indefinite states of mind and expressed in sumptuous textures, remained his central concern, and the exploratory freedom with which he investigated the suggestive potential of colour contributed considerably to Post-Impressionist art. His innovations were admired by the Nabis and by some of the Fauves, including Henri Matisse. The Nabis were a group of painters formed in 1892 by Paul Serusier who admired Gaugin’s expressive use of colour and rhythmic pattern. The term Nabis is derived from the Hebrew word for prophets.\n\nFrom about 1890 Odilon Redon began to extend his use of colour, but his use of pastels also became frequent. During the next decade he used colour alongside monochrome, with colour gradually becoming the dominant force. Earlier subject matter was reinterpreted, but new motifs also appeared, flowers, especially, becoming a central preoccupation. The increasingly decorative tone of these works led to commissions for screens and murals, an outstanding example being the 1910-1 paintings on the walls of the library at Fontfroide Abbey near Narbonne. \n\nRedon held his first Paris exhibitions at the time of the early lithograph albums, showing charcoal drawings at the review La Vie Moderne (1881) and in the newspaper Le Gaulois (1882). In 1884 he helped to organise the first Salon des Indépendants and in 1886 exhibited both at the last Impressionist Exhibition and with Les Vingt in Brussels. Although his Noirs charcoal drawings made little impact on the general public, they won acclaim among the Parisian literary avant-garde. The aesthetic principles underlying Redon’s art were close to those of Baudelaire, and summarised by the writer Paul Bourget in that, however great temporal corruption and decay may be, artistic ideals will transcend them. Emile Hennequin and Joris-Karl Huysmans became his champions; the Noirs figured in Huysmans’s decadent novel A rebours (1884, Paris).','France','Odilon','Redon',1840,1916,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odilon_Redon',1),(114,'English painter and printmaker. Bridget Riley was born in Norwood, London, in 1931, and later studied at Goldsmith College, London University (1949-52) and the Royal College of Art (1952-5). She worked as an illustrator for J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, while initially painting in a pointillist style as encouraged by her mentor Maurice de Sausmarez (see Provenance). Citing the art of Georges Seurat as a major influence, Riley was also inspired by a large exhibition of Jackson Pollock held at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1958. \nExtending the optical effects of pointillism towards a more disorientating effect on the eye, Riley began to use simple shapes, such as squares, triangles and circles and distorting or rearranging them. This could create the effect of an undulating surface (such as Straight Curve; 1963); in Blaze 2 (1963; Belfast), a revolving tunnel effect emerged from spiraling black and white V-shapes; in Current (1964; New York, MoMA) a mass of parallel, but slightly curved, lines created the feeling of a strong wind passing over the canvas. These, together with most works produced between 1961-5, saw Riley work in black and white, the vivid contrast aiding their intense energy. \nIn 1965, Riley’s work was exhibited at MoMA, New York, as part of The Responsive Eye, an important show often said to have launched Op Art, a style of painting or sculpture that exploits the illusions or optical effects of perceptual processes.Untitled was completed the following year and exemplifies the direction that Riley’s work was beginning to take at this point in her career. It is one of the first instances where she utilises the curved line, a development that informs much of her output of the 1970s and is central to her exploration of colour and light. The piece is dedicated to Ben Nicholson, a fellow English artist whom Riley much admired. \n\nWtihin this exploration Riley adopted colour induction, often using white to infiltrate one colour into another, to either form a third colour or to limit the effect of the others. Black was also reintroduced extending the expressive range of the images, as is illustrated in Firmus (1972-3; London, Tate). During the 1980s Riley travelled to Egypt, inspiring the Ka and Ra series which reflect the colours of the Egyptian countryside. \n\nRiley was the first female to win the International Painting Prize at the Venice Biennale in 1968. She continues to have a prominent position in today’s art scene: Riley’s paintings took centre stage in the National Gallery’s New Paintings and Related Work exhibition in 2011; in 2012 she was the first woman to receive the Sikkens Prize, a prestigious Dutch art award that recognises the use of colour.','England','Bridget','Riley',1931,-1,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Riley',1),(115,'Canadian painter and sculptor. From an early age Jean-Paul Riopelledrew extensively and painted landscapes from nature. From 1939 to 1941 he studied at Montreal Polytechnic while also taking a correspondence course in architecture. He temporarily abandoned painting in 1941, but from 1943 to 1945 he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Montreal and at the École du Meuble, where he spent most of his time. He and like-minded painters, later known as Les Automatistes, met regularly in the studio of Paul-Émile Borduas at the École du Meuble, to discuss their interest in abstract art, Surrealism and automatic techniques.\nRiopelle first visited Paris in 1946 and settled there a year later. He was included by André Breton and Marcel Duchamp in the last major group show of the Surrealist movement at the Galerie Maeght in 1947 and met Georges Mathieu, Maria Elena Vieira da Silva, Nicolas de Stäel among others. His own paintings, such as the Green Parrot (1949; Musée Québec), were tachiste in character, with wild, sweeping brushstrokes, but this gradually gave way to a technique in which blobs of paint were squeezed directly from the tube on to the canvas, their threads trailing across the surface so that they criss-cross in a number of directions. The dense, matted paint and gleaming colours have sometimes been interpreted as a memory of the dark Canadian forests that Riopelle knew well in his youth, but the paintings were executed in a trance-like state of intense improvisation.\nFrom the late 1950s most of Riopelle’s paintings were no longer completely abstract but took as a starting point representations of landscapes or animals, sometimes based on photographs or stuffed birds, which he treated in caricatural manner and often subjected to a process of virtual obliteration. He also began In 1958 he also began to model sculptures for casting in bronze, such as Don Quixote (1961; Washington, D.C., Hirshhorn), exhibiting them first in 1962. From1960 he employed a wider range of techniques and materials: not only sculpture but pastel, lithography, collage, enamel, acrylic and mosaic.

They are marked by a strong graphic quality and by the interpretation of clearly defined, angular areas of unmodulated colour. During the 1950s he executed several commissions for wall decorations in glass mosaic, notably for Svenska Handelsbanken in Stockholm and the Östersund Post Office (1948-52).

Born in Paris, George Rouault’s interest in the world of the circus found its greatest outlet in his art during the 1930s when Ambroise Vollard commissioned him to make etchings and woodcuts for the book Cirque de l\'Étoile Filante, published in 1938. These depictions were based on his own childhood memories of the circus, as he remembered them: ‘Acrobats and horsewomen, sparkling or passive clowns, tightrope walkers and freaks, and my friends, color and harmony, since my earliest childhood I have been in love with you’ (quoted in Bernard Dorival and Isabelle Rouault’s GeorgesRouault: l\'Oeuvre peint, Monte Carlo, 1988, vol. I, p. 153). \n\nRouault was particularly drawn to the clowns and their expressive potential as subjects for portraiture. These nomadic entertainers represented freedom and naïveté, and were for Rouault a release from his focus on the darker images of life. His series of clown portraits is marked by an emotional immediacy that is unique both within his oeuvre and the spectrum of modern art. Lionello Venturi writes: ‘When he paints clowns, however, the grotesque becomes amiable, even lovable... colours grow rich and resplendent, almost as if the artist, laying aside his crusader’s arms for a moment, were relaxing in the light of the sun and letting it flood into his work,’ (Lionello Venturi, Rouault, Lausanne, 1959, pp. 21 & 51).\n\nRouault’s use of black underpainting imbues the subject with a profound, almost spiritual, depth. He employs broad Expressionistic brushstrokes that deconstruct forms and bring his subject to the edge of abstraction. Rouault’s style was also greatly influenced by the work of Henri Matisse with whom he had exhibited at the Salon d’Automne in 1905 alongside other Fauvist artists.','France','Georges','Rouault',1871,1958,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Rouault',1),(118,'French sculptor, writer, stage designer and filmmaker. Niki de Saint Phalle spent the first 20 years of her life in New York. A self-taught artist, on her return to Europe she began to work in a style similar to Art Brut. She first came to public attention through the Shots series of 1960-1, ironic parodies of Art Informel painting, comprising plaster reliefs incorporating pockets of paint, which burst when fired at by visitors to the exhibition, thus staining the surface. Through these works Saint Phalle became associated with Nouveau Réalisme. She produced reliefs and sculptures made of objets trouvés and plastic toys. Monsters and other fantastic creatures were also among her favourite themes (e.g. King Kong, 1963; Stockholm, Moderna Museet), while other assemblages were in the form of iconoclastic altars.\n\nSaint Phalle’s next series were concerned with the representation of women, as in the series of Brides (e.g. Bride, 1963; Paris, Pompidou). This led to the renowned Nanas series, begun in 1964; daubed in bright colours, the larger-than-life athletic females glorified an art of play and festivity. The apotheosis was the monumental She: A Cathedral (1966; Stockholm, Moderna Museet, destroyed); constructed in collaboration with Jean Tinguely, and Per Olof Ultveldt. It was a huge shell of a reclining woman, 28-metres long, inside which were rooms, including a cinema and a bar. It was Tinguely, who she had met in 1956 and began living with in 1964, who introduced her to Pontus Hulten, the Director of the ModernaMuseet in Stockholm, who organised many important exhibitions at that time, and bought some of Saint Phalle’s works for the museum.\n\nFrom the 1960s Saint Phalle devoted herself mainly to monumental sculptures, sometimes intended more directly for children: Fantastic Paradise (1967; Montreal, Expo ’67, French Pavillion, present whereabouts unknown; with Tinguely); The Golem (1972; Jerusalem; with Tinguely); Dragon (1973; Knokke-het-Zoute); the Stravinsky Fountain with its colourful vegetal forms (1983; Paris, Pompidou; with Tinguely). \n\nIn 1955 Saint Phalle had visited Barcelona, Spain where she discovered the work of Antoni Gaudi.These visits, and particularly Gaudi’s Park Güell, changed her life, and gave her the idea of creating a garden of sculpture which finally took its form with The Tarocchi Garden, which was begun in Tuscany in 1979.Not only was Gaudi’s work an inspiration butalso the spirit of the ‘monster’ garden at Bomarzo, in Lazio, Italy, which gave Saint Phalle the idea to conceive a fantasticgarden fullof imaginary creatures and dream architecture. \n\nThe TarocchiGarden was officially opened in 1998.In a section of the garden Saint Phalle made sculptures to represent 21 Tarot cards of which Angle of Temperance was card XIIII.Saint Phalle is quoted as saying “I had great difficulty understanding this card.It was too far from my passionate nature.Temperance seemed to me to be a compromise a middle road. One day the light dawned. Temperance is the right way – I made an angel of this card which crowns the Chapel of Temperance.” \n\nSaint Phalle also produced several illustrated books, designed sets for the ballet and made films, including Daddy (1973).In 1986 she published Aids, You Can’t Catch it Holding Hands (Munich), a combination of words and images. In 1983 Saint Phalle again collaborated with Tinguely on the Stravinsky Fountain (mentioned above), next to the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. The voluminous, colourful vegetal forms are the work of Saint Phalle, while the black metal mechanisms were devised by Tinguely.

Ragnar Sandberg was born 1902 in southern Sweden. He studied at the Valand Konsthögskolan in Gothenburg under the tutelage of the inspirational Tor Bjurström who encouraged, in particular, Henri Matisse’s expressive use of colour. Sandberg progressed to become a member of the Göteborgskolorister (Gothenburg Colourists), a group of artists from the west coast of Sweden who began to adopt lyrical colour characteristics that marked them out from other Swedish art movements. Apart from Sandberg, the most well-known artists in the group were Ivan Ivarson, Nils Nilsson, Åke Göransson and Inge Schiöler.\n\nIn 1926 Sandberg made a trip to Paris together with fellow Gothenburg Colourists David Larsson and Nils Nilsson. Sandberg had his first exhibition with other Valand pupils in 1927. Major influences for these artists beyond Matisse, were van Gogh, Munch, Cézanne and Bonnard. In 1928 he married Elsa Karlsson. Sandberg was also keenly interested in literature and considered turning away from a painting career and becoming a writer. However, due to meeting former classmate and artist Ivan Ivarsson again, he was inspired to return to painting. \n\nFrom the early 1930s Sandberg was based in Gothenburg and his style of painting can be described as lyrical, bright and colourful, often depicting spontaneous scenes that capture the immediacy of everyday life. His palette consisted of bright, clear colours, especially so in his paintings of bathers, cyclists and football players, which glitter with witty touches and were often painted from memory. \n\nIn 1935 Sandberg had a solo exhibition at Paletten in Gothenburg. Although originally on a mission to ‘loosen up form’ in Swedish art, he began to display a refinement of economy from about 1940 when he introduced grey as a background as well as muted colours into much more structured compositions, resulting in paintings of a more restrained nature. In 1947 he moved to Stockholm becoming Professor of Drawing at the city’s Konsthögskolan and, between 1949 and 1958, he became Professor of Painting at the same school. \n\nHanhals, where Sandberg’s I Köksfönstret was painted, is situated near Kungsbacka on the Swedish west coast in the Halland landscape, just south of Gothenburg. He has exhibited in both solo and group exhibitions in London.\n\nEleven of Sandberg’s paintings were included in the Venice Biennale in 1952. In 1958 he won the National Section of the prestigious Guggenheim International Award (GIA) established only two year’s previously as a biennial award ‘to stimulate interest in contemporary art and in this way encourage the work of artists throughout the world’. The GIA was also the largest art prize of its time. In 1960 Sandberg married Swedish painter and portraitist Birgit Broms. In the 1950 to 1960s he made several trips to Italy and it was during this period that he concentrated on still lifes and his palette consisted of greys and ochres. However, by the late 1960s he had returned to the imagery of his work in the 1930s: birds, bathers and football players. In 1966 he purchased a house at Stenungsön in the west coast archipelago.\n\nIn October 1972 a retrospective exhibition was held at Konstakademien in Stockholm. Sandberg died a month later in Stockholm.','Sweden','Ragnar','Sandberg',1902,1972,1,'',1),(120,'Swedish painter. Inge Schiöler was born in Strömstad in 1908. His father was a bank official by profession, but also wrote children’s books, poetry and was a talented photographer. His mother studied at the Swedish Kungliga Musikhögskolan (Royal Academy of Music in Stockholm). Schiöler started his art training at the Högskolan för Design och Konsthantverk (College of Design and Craft) and then went on to the Valand Konsthögskolan, both in Gothenburg. Schiöler becamethe youngest member of a group of artists from the west coast of Sweden who embraced the powerful and emotional use of colour advantages as espoused by Edvard Munch and Paul Gauguin. This group became known as the Göteborgskoloristerna(Gothenburg Colourists), a term that was popularised following publication of a book about them in 1948.\n\nAfter his studies Schiöler worked as a mess-room waiter, did his military service and visited Paris and Spain. In 1932 he had his first one-man exhibition at the Swedish-French Art Gallery in Stockholm. In the autumn of 1933 he was afflicted by schizophrenia and, apart from brief intervals, spent the next 27 years (until 1960) at St Jörgens mental hospital, during which time he experienced long periods when he was unable to paint. A small body of work survives from this period, painted on whatever he could find – including toilet paper and cards. His family built him a cottage on the island of Koster in the Strömstad archipelago as a refuge.\n\nThe surroundings of Schiöler’s home town, Strömstad – and especially scenes from the island of Syd-Koster – provided him with the inspiration for the paintings which, in the early 1930s, placed him on a level with the best of Swedish landscape artists. Indeed, sources for Schiöler’sart were obtained closer to home in the richly hued paintings of Karl Isakson and from Carl Kylberg, who in 1927 exhibited a number of works at the Göteborgs Konsthall. This was next door to the ValandKonsthögskolan, where the Göteborgskoloristernamet as students.\n\nDuring the 1960s, modern medicine was able to alleviate Schiöler’s troubles and he resumed painting.

Anshelm Leonard Schultzberg was born in 1862 and studied in Stockholm at the Edward Perseus Technical School (1881) and the Academy of Fine Arts (1882-6). A celebrated artist, he specialised in winter landscapes, particularly around areas such as Dalarna, Varmland and Bergslagen, and sunlit apple trees covered in blossom. He was rewarded with a royal medal for Autumn Landscape and spent 1889-90 in France and 1891-2 in Italy around the Naples area, both the art and the landscapes of these countries influencing his style. The French Ruralist and Social Realist artists of the 1880s and their depiction of working men and women particularly struck a chord with Schultzberg and his contemporaries in Sweden. The painting techniques derived from artists such as Jules Bastien-Lepage and Schultzberg’s time in Grez-Sur-Loing, slowly gave way to a more Impressionistic and fluid style in his later years.\n\nSchultzberg received medals in Paris (1889) and in Chicago (1893) and was recognised at the 1904 World’s Fair in Saint Louis, USA for the structural design of the Swedish exhibition. These medals were issued at major art events around the world, normally with some prize money attached, for what were considered the most accomplished works of art for that particular exposition. Schultzberg represented Sweden on a number of occasions at international exhibitions, including Rome in 1911 and San Francisco in 1915.

Born and raised in Hanover, Germany, Kurt Schwitters’s most famous works are his Cubist-inspired assemblages, which he began to produce around 1918. Composed of bits of wood, newspaper and other debris, and often nailed or glued together, they came, according to the artist, from a desire to create new forms from the shattered remains of the pre-war world.Schwitters expanded his principles of assemblage to encompass other art forms, including poetry and performance, and coined the term ‘Merz’ as a generic word for his oeuvre. It was through his association with Der Sturm and his meeting with Hans Arp that he established contact with the Dadaists, although he never officially joined the movement after feuding with Richard Huelsenbeck, who excluded him from the Berlin wing. From this time,‘Merz’ became the name of Schwitters’s one-man movement and philosophy. The word derives from a fragment of the word ‘Kommerz’, used in an early assemblage for which Schwitters subsequently gave a number of meanings, the most frequent being that of ‘refuse’ or ‘rejects’. In 1919 he wrote: ‘The word “Merz” denotes essentially the combination, for artistic purposes, of all conceivable materials, and, technically, the principle of the equal distribution of the individual materials… A perambulator wheel, wire-netting, string and cotton wool are factors having equal rights with paint.’ Such materials were indeed incorporated in Schwitters’s large assemblages and painted collages of this period. \n\nAfter 1923 his work was influenced by De Stijl and Constructivism. In the same year he began his magnum opus, the extraordinary Merzbau. It was a vast sculptural construction which took over part of the artist’s home and studio in Hanover and remained unfinished when he left Germany in December 1936. He had spoken early in his career of his ‘ultimate aspiration’ being ‘the union of art and non-art in the Merz total world view’. The refuse and objets trouvés of his assemblages, collected and stored with a manic passion in suitcases and specially made wooden boxes, became the cult objects of what was, in Max Ernst’s words, ‘a huge abstract grotto’, made around and within a basic structure of wire, wood and plastered struts. The Merzbau was in effect an elaborate autobiographical ‘growth’ of interconnecting grottos, in which pieces of friends’ clothing, hair and even the artist’s own bottled urine were placed alongside a host of other bizarre objects stored in compartments and behind secret panels. It was entirely destroyed by an Allied bomb in 1943. Forced to flee Nazi persecution in 1937, Schwitters moved first to Norway and then in 1940 to Britain, where he later died in obscurity.','Germany','Kurt','Schwitters',1887,1948,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Schwitters',1),(123,'Swedish painter.

His parents were missionaries, Johan Arms and Eva Charlotte Eriksdotter.Sköld was a student at the Althin School of Art and at Wilhelm’s Academy and finally at the Technical School in Stockholm from 1912 to 1914. He then left for Copenhagen where through artistic circles he discovered the Parisian avant-garde.In 1918 and 1919 he participated in exhibitions at Liljevalchs Gallery, Stockholm, showing several Cubist paintings to great acclaim. His success caught the attention of the art dealer Gösta Olson who then championed his work and funded Sköld to travel to Paris with his wife Arna. In Paris, Sköld abandoned Cubist painting, which had occupied him during the early part of the 20thcentury and instead developed a new naïve style, which in Sweden came to be known as ‘Nysaklighet’.\n\nA recurring theme in his paintings during the years in Paris was the city itself. He often portrayed the city’s rooftops, cafés and bars. A typical example can be found in the Stockholm Moderna Museet, entitled Rooftops in Paris and painted in 1921-2, where the grey-black roofs and house façades contrast with the buildings’ vivid red and jet-black chimneys against the bright, hazy sky. In Paris he attended the Académie Scandinave before returning to Sweden in 1929 where he founded a school of painting together with Åke Pernby. Sköld was Director of the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm between 1950 and 1958 where he developed the Moderna Museet in the old drill hall on Skeppsholem in Stockholm.Previously Pablo Picasso’s Guernica and the 93 attendant sketches had been exhibited there prior to the Museum’s creation.

Pierre Soulages was greatly impressed as a boy by the Celtic carvings in the museum at Rodez, Aveyron, in southern France where he was born,as well as by the architecture and sculpture of the Romanesque Abbey of Sainte-Foy at Conques. In 1938 he went to Paris for the first time, where he visited the Louvre and saw exhibitions of Paul Cézanne and Pablo Picasso. With the intention of training to be a drawing teacher, he enrolled in a studio in Paris but was encouraged instead to enter the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts. He was, however, bitterly disappointed by what was being taught there, which seemed to fall far short of what he had just seen, so he returned to Rodez. The paintings he was making at this time were of leafless trees in winter, the black branches forming a tracery against the sky. He was called up in 1941 but demobilised almost at once. He was able to do very little painting during the Occupation, but it was here he became aware of abstract art through his friendship with Sonia Delaunay.\n\nSoulages’s career as a painter dates from 1946, when he moved to Courbevoie outside Paris. His earliest abstract pictures are of broad straight and curved brushstrokes like bars forming a compact and centralised image against a white background. These were followed by paintings in oil, often on a much larger scale, with heavy black bar-like strokes overlaying patches of white or colour. Although their severe, monumental character and preoccupation with black set them apart from almost all other Parisian abstract painting of the time, he was soon recognised internationally as one of the major figures in the post-war abstract movement.','France','Pierre','Soulages',1919,-1,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Soulages',1),(125,'French painter of Russian birth. Nicolas de Staël was born in Russia to an aristocratic family forced into exile in 1919 as a result of the Russian Revolution. In 1922, orphaned, he and his sisters were sent to Brussels to live with wealthy Russian expatriates. Between 1933 and 1936 he studied in Brussels, attending courses on architecture at the Académie de St. Giles and in decoration and design at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts. In August 1937 he met the painter Jeannine Guillou who became his companion until her death (1946). Together they travelled to Algeria and Italy, where de Staël applied himself to studies of Italian art, returning to Paris in 1938. There he made copies after Old Master paintings in the Musée du Louvre, especially those of Chardin and Delacroix; in the summer months he painted landscapes in Brittany.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II he served with the Foreign Legion until he was demobilised in 1940, when he rejoined Guillou in Nice, France. There they became part of a lively circle of avant-garde artists, including Alberto Magnelli and Sonia Delaunay, who influenced the direction of his work. It was here that de Staël first abandoned direct representation in his work, although he continued to refer obliquely to the formal rhythms of real objects. Returning to Paris he held his first one-man show at the Galerie L’Esquisse, followed by an exhibition in a mixed show at the Galerie Jeanne Bucher (see Provenance above) in 1945. Through Bucher’s gallery he befriended another Russian emigré painter, André Lanskoy, whose example led him to use thick paint and to develop a rich and textured surface, as illustrated in Hard Life (1946; Paris, Pompidou).\n\nIn 1948 deStaël acquired French citizenship and began to receive considerable notices. The title Paysage (as above) became more and more present in his work as of 1952, replacing that of Composition. His friendship with poet René Char at this time encouraged his inclination to rediscover what he referred to as his childhood passion for vast skies. The series of exquisite landscapes painted in and around Paris and the Normandy seascapes that followed are reminiscent in their use of low horizons of the Flemish and Dutch landscapes he admired in his youth. Never simply reproducing the forms of nature, he gave them pictorial structure through the tactile quality of the paint. De Staël did not consider abstraction and representation to be in opposition with each other, especially as natural phenomena consistently provided the basis for his paintings. Never simply reproducing the forms of nature, he gave them pictorial structure through the tactile quality of the paint.\n\nSince Nicolas de Staël’s childhood – he was born beside a river, then spent his pre-adult years not far from the North Sea – water held an element of fascination and inspiration. Seascapes, more so than any other subject, allowed him to go beyond the dichotomy of abstract-figurative art. Marine à Dieppe (Plage) was painted in 1952, the year in which de Staël painted a large number of seascapes.This painting presents a succession of bands of colour placed horizontally. The subject participates in this ambiguity between abstract and figurative art by bringing them together. The composition, very sober and reduced to a few lines, as well as the space constructed from different areas of colour, are sufficient to render the essence of the seascape. A wonderful colourist, de Staël presents us with an extraordinary variation of blues, from deep navy through to emerald tints, the flat areas of white bringing out the radiance of the colour by giving it structure.\nBetween 1952 and 1955, de Staël travelled often, executing different series of landscapes in which, at each occasion, the visual components were totally changed if not turned upside down. He went to London, New York, the north of Italy, down the Italian peninsula as far as Sicily, across to Spain, as well as finding time to visit Paris and the north and south of France. Light, matter, coloured forms and the conception of the composition of his work changed radically according to his subject: landscapes of Normandy or the south of Italy, for example. The local light, relived by the artist, was a fundamental element in his landscapes which started with the blues and greys of Paris and the north of France.\nDe Staël’s brilliance has left a long-lasting mark in art history. At his premature death in 1955, at the age of 41, he had executed in all some 1,100 paintings and circa 1,200 works on paper.','France','Nicolas','de Staël',1914,1955,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_de_Sta%C3%Abl',1),(126,'Swedish artist.

In addition to his writing, Strindberg pursued any number of eccentric interests, including occultism, Swedenborgianism (The New Church) and alchemy. However, Strindberg’s paintings offered vehicles for his belief that chance played a crucial part in the creative process and were unique for their time, going beyond those of his contemporaries for their radical lack of adherence to visual reality. \n\nThe 117 paintings that are acknowledged as his, were mostly painted within the span of a few years, and are now seen by some as among the most original works of 19th-century art. Today, his best-known pieces are stormy, Expressionist seascapes. Though Strindberg was friends with Edvard Munch and Paul Gauguin, and was thus familiar with modern trends, the spontaneous and subjective expressiveness of his landscapes and seascapes can be ascribed also to the fact that he painted only in periods of personal crisis. After he stopped painting in 1874 he became Sweden’s leading art critic, as well as the ideological leader of the radical Swedish artists’ movement, which in 1884 formed the Konstnärsförbund (the Artists’ Association) in protest against Stockholm’s Academy of Art. Prominent among its members were the painters Carl Olof Larsson, Karl Nordström and Richard Bergh.\n\nStrindberg changed his field of activity time and again when he saw obstacles within the area of his current work. Painting became an alternative means of expression when other paths, particularly in his writing, seemed to be closed. A prolific writer who often drew directly on his personal experience, Strindberg’s career spanned four decades, during which time he wrote over 60 plays and more than 30 works of fiction, autobiography, history, cultural analysis and politics. A bold experimenter and iconoclast throughout, he explored a wide range of dramatic methods and purposes, from naturalistic tragedy and history plays, to his anticipations of Expressionist and Surrealist dramatic techniques.\n\nHaving resumed painting again on Dalarö in the Stockholm archipelago in 1892, August Johann Strindberg hosted his own one-man exhibition at the Birger Jarls Bazar in Stockholm. This was made up almost exclusively of more spontaneous depictions of the sea and its storms, with pure oils applied directly onto canvas or panels and obvious use of the palette knife. This same year saw Strindberg move to Berlin where he associated himself with Scandinavian and German writers and artists, including the young Edvard Munch with whom he exhibited at the Salon des Refusés in Berlin (1893). \n\nAfter his second marriage to Austrian journalist Frida Uhl, he painted several semi-abstract paintings in Dornach, Austria, such as the large Wonderland (1894; Stockholm, Nordiska Museet), before travelling to Paris in the autumn of 1894 to work as a playwright and arts journalist. This was also the year in which Strindberg created his two most abstract paintings: Snowstorm at Sea (Stockholm, Nordiska Museet) and Heavy Sea. A year later he held his final Parisian exhibition, at Hôtel Drouot, which included his letter to close friend Paul Gauguin published in the sale catalogue.\n\nStrindberg did not resume painting again until 1901, after a serious breakdown in his third marriage to Norwegian-Swedish actress Harriet Bosse (see Provenance). Strindberg’s style now illustrated a symbolic undertone of death and destruction with vivid skies, as is illustrated in The Wave (1901; Paris, Musée d’Orsay) and The City (1903; Stockholm, Nordiska Museet). These emotive undertones can also be depicted via romantic motifs of the forest, such as in this example, The Birch Tree I (Autumn), painted in Stockholm in 1902, and The Spruce Forest (1905; Stockholm, Nordiska Museet) which, by all accounts, seems to be the last example of Strindberg’s painting. Beyond 1905 he focused on photography and playwriting, and did not truly make his name as an artist in his lifetime. This came in 1962 and beyond, when a number of international exhibitions of his work were held, including a one-man exhibition at the Venice Biennale in 1980.','Sweden','August Johan','Strindberg',1849,1912,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Johan_Strindberg',1),(128,'English painter and printmaker.Born in London, Graham Sutherland studied at the city’s Goldsmiths College, University of London(1921-6)and began his career as a printmaker, producing small, poetic, densely worked etchings of rural England, influenced by the early etchings of Samuel Palmer. He only began to find his way as a painter in 1934 when he first made a visit to Pembrokeshire, Wales, a source of repeated inspiration. He began to make drawings and watercolours in a sketchbook thathe could work up in his studio and became fascinated by objets trouvés such as root forms and fragments of thorn brushes that demonstrated the principles of organic growth. Not only did the objects take on a metamorphic character, with suggestions of animal or human forms, but their dramatic impact was enhanced by rich, emotive colour.\n\nFrom 1940to 1945 Sutherland was employed as an Official War Artist to make depictions, mainly drawings, of bomb damage in south Wales and London, blast furnaces, tin mining in Cornwall, limestone quarrying, opencast coal mining, and, finally, after the liberation of France, views of the bomb damage done by the RAF to railway marshalling yards and flying bomb depots. His pictures of air-raid devastation in London are among the most vivid and memorable records of the Blitz. In 1946 Sutherland painted a large Crucifixion for the church of \nSt Matthew, Northampton.It was both his first life-size representation of the human figure and the first of several paintings on religious themes, it was preceded by a series of studies of thorn trees and thorn heads suggested by the image of the crown of thorns.\n\nHaving visited the south of France for the first time in 1947, Sutherland then spent part of each year there. From 1949 to 1957 he worked on a series of ‘standing forms’ in which shapes developed from fragments of roots and trees were placed upright, sometimes two or three in a row, against a background such as a hedge; each form was intended to evoke the presence of a human figure.\n\nReturning to Pembrokeshire in 1967 for the first time in over 20 years, Sutherland found, to his surprise, that the landscape there had just as much fascination for him as ever. As a result, almost all of his nature paintings from then on were based once again on Pembrokeshire themes. As a token to Pembrokeshire and the people of Wales, he founded a museum of his own work at Picton Castle, which was opened in 1976.','England','Graham','Sutherland',1903,1980,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Sutherland',1),(129,'Swedish painter. Born in Stockholm in 1910, Roland Svensson studied at the city’s Royal Academy of Fine Art, but later, in 1936, in London and France. During his 60-year artistic career, he became a foremost portrayer of the outer islands and islets of the Stockholm archipelago. His studio was on the island Möja. His works, whether as a black-and-white artist, painter, book illustrator or writer, are marked by a strong sense of reality with a particular empathy for the environment and lives of the fishing population. Much of his oeuvre was inspired by his elder compatriot Albert Engström, also a painter, illustrator and writer. \n\nSvensson’s first exhibition was as a part of a group exhibition at Röda Kvarn in Stockholm in 1937. His first solo show (which became his breakthrough as an artist) was at Galerie Moderne in Stockholm in 1940. He continued to have solo exhibitions in the city, of note being those in 1943, 1947 and 1955.\n\nHis fascination for islands and islets didn’t only rest with the Swedish archipelago. Between the years 1947-58 he made several trips to Scotland’s Orkney, Shetland and Faroe islands. In 1963 he set out for the remote South Atlantic island of Tristan da Cunha on board the M/V Bornholm which was returning evacuees from the island’s 1961 volcanic eruption. For this island he created four sets of stamps (1972-86) marking the passage of time from longboats to the modern new harbour. His initial set was the first not to include the face or silhouette of Queen Elizabeth II.\nIn 1978 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Stockholm.

Son of David Teniers the Elder, Teniers the Younger became a master of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1632-3 after an apprenticeship to his father, with whom he also collaborated. In 1637 he married Anna, the daughter and heiress of Jan Breughel the Elder. From the outset, Teniers the Younger was an extremely productive painter thanks to his good relationship with Antwerp art dealers. During the 1630s he produced small-format religious scenes on commission for Chrysostoom van Immerseel who supplied the Spanish market. However, it was Teniers’s genre pieces that were greatly prized by the Antwerp dealers and made him famous.\n\nTeniers quickly became one of Antwerp’s most successful painters, which probably accounts for his assumption of functions that carried a degree of social prominence, such as the office of Master of the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament in the St Jacobskerk, Antwerp, between 1637 and 1639, and Dean of the Guild of St Luke in 1644-5. He also received such prestigious commissions as the large group portrait, Arquebusiers’ Company (1643; St Petersburg, Hermitage). During this same Antwerp period he also executed commissions for Antonine Triest, the Bishop of Bruges, one of the most prominent patrons of the arts in the southern Netherlands. By 1647 Teniers was working for Archduke Leopold William, Governor of the southern Netherlands from 1646, and in 1651 he became the Archduke’s court painter. He consequently moved from Antwerp to the court at Brussels and, in 1656, bought a building near the archducal palace and had it rebuilt as a spacious and handsome house and studio.\n\nThe present picture shows an alchemist in his laboratory as he consults his book of formulae.The intention of alchemy was to turn base metal into gold by the addition of the ‘philosopher’s stone’.Although the practice was scientifically flawed, and often considered heretical, the techniques used, such as distillation and metallurgy, contributed a great deal to the development of science and industry.The 17th century witnessed a significant tension between religious beliefs and the scientific advances which would eventually become the Enlightenment.When the effect of this scientific revolution acted in combination with the rise in the popularity of ‘genre painting’, the number of representations of alchemists greatly increased.Teniers was at the forefront of this style of genre painting and the Alchemist’s assistants, who are ostensibly grinding raw materials, more closely resemble card players or drinkers in a tavern in many of his other compositions.','Netherlands','David','Teniers the Younger',1610,1690,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Teniers_the_Younger',1),(132,'American painter, draughtsman and printmaker.

In 1938 Thiebaud studied commercial art at the Frank Wiggins Trade School in Los Angeles, later working in Long Beach as a cartoonist.After World War II he attended San Jose State College and Sacramento State College,California, majoring in art. Working as an art instructor at Sacramento Junior College from 1951-60, Thiebaud experimented with various styles of painting, paying particular attention to that of the Abstract Expressionist painters he met in New York in 1956-7.\n\nIn 1960 Thiebaud began teaching in the art department of the University of California at Davis. In this year he began to paint stilllifes of items of food such as pies and cakes and of banal contemporary objects. Although the imagery of these works contributed to the iconography of Pop Art, they were painted with succulent brushstrokes far removed from the depersonalised handling favoured by most Pop painters. After 1966 he turned increasingly to landscapes, first favouring rural landscapes, and then depopulated urban landscapes.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1972 Theibaud taught at the University of California.

Theodor Esaias Thorén was born in Halmstad, Sweden in 1901, to a father who made fine furniture. Inspired by the art of Gösta Adrian-Nilsson (GAN),which he first saw as a teenager, Thorén began painting. During the early 1920s, he also experimented with wooden sculptures and reliefs in his father’s workshop. With fellow artist Sven Jonson he formed The Young duo in 1923 under the tutelage of Axel Olson; the duo exhibited in Halmstad a year later. In 1925 Thorén attended Carl Wilhelmson’s private art school in Stockholm before travelling with Jonson to Paris to study under Otte Sköld. But they both returned to Halmstad in the spring of 1927, opening a combined atelier and painting school that attracted the town’s artists and intellectuals.\n\nThorén finally met Adrian-Nilsson in 1928, the year in which Konstruktion VIII was created. By 1929 he became a founding member of the influential Halmstad Group (Halmstadgruppen) along with brothers Axel and Erik Olson, their cousin Waldemar Lorentzon, Stellan Mörner and Sven Jonson. The group was influenced in particular by Salvador Dalí and Yves Tanguy. By the end of the decade Thorén shifted from a predominantly post-Cubist style to Purism (an admiration for the beauty and structural purity of the machine) and concrete art. \n\nHe returned to study in 1931, this time, doing graphics at the Royal Swedish Academy of Art in Stockholm. His paintings became more Purist in composition while his sculptural objects and reliefs, under the influence of Adrian-Nilsson, displayed a Futuristic spirit. Along with most of the members of the Halmstad Group, Thorén’s output adopted a Surrealist approach as was revealed when he participated in the bold Kubisme-Surrealisme exhibitionin Copenhagen (1935) and further international Surrealist shows in London (1936 and 1937) and Paris (1938). \n\nWithout abandoning but rather modifying Surrealism, Thorén’s output of the 1940s and early 1950s became more eclectic and politically conscious. He joined the Söndrum Colony, an association of artists (Sven Erixson or ‘X-et’, Felix Hatz and Vilhelm Bjerke Petersen), poets (Elsa Grave) and academics (Erik Lindegren) based on the Halmstad coastal strip.

Luis Tomasello was born in 1915 in La Plata, Argentina, and studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires. Initially he worked in the figurative style, but by the 1950s he was working with geometric abstraction. He made his first trip to Europe in 1945, followed by others including a visit in 1951, to Sicily, the island from which his father had emigrated. He has cited being particularly inspired by the paintings of Piet Mondrian and the medieval stained glass of Chartres Cathedral. In 1954 he formed the New Art Association in Buenos Aires, with, among others, Surrealist-promoting art critic Aldo Pellegrini and Argentinian-German sculptor Martin Blaszko. \n\nAfter settling in Paris in 1957, Tomasello exhibited with a group of artists whose explorations took them from constructivist abstraction to cinetism, an art form founded on optical illusion fashionable during 1950-1963. He was promoted by the avant-garde Galerie Denise René in Paris and soon his works were hung in several national and international exhibitions of Op Art, including the landmark show La Lumière et le Mouvement (1967). A year later, Tomasello created this Atmosphère Chromoplastiques No. 194, one of a series of images for which he is particularly known.

Tournes is represented in many of the museums in France and abroad, in particular the Musée d’Orsay, Paris (La Toilette), the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Bordeaux (Jeune Femme se Peignant) and the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dijon (La Première Communiante).\n\nThe painting shown here, which commemorates the Bastille Day celebrations in 1889, captures the exuberant demonstration of national pride. The presence of the Republican Guard in the right-hand corner alludes to the military parade held every Bastille Day since 1880 when Benjamin Raspail proposed a law to have ‘the Republic choose the 14 July as a yearly national holiday’. It was subsequently decreed that this day ‘should be celebrated with all the brilliance that the local resources allow’. Charles Rearick provides a compelling account of the palpable excitement that pervaded the first Bastille Day in 1880: ‘A warm, sunny day, it was a holiday unlike any other. Not even a rainstorm in the evening could spoil it. In Paris it had begun with a volley of cannon shots at 8am; in the country, several hours earlier, villagers had awakened to fanfares of rifle fire and ringing church bells; firecrackers and band music followed. Streets were bedecked with flags and bunting, and in some places banners, garlands and triumphal arches as well. Parts of central Paris became a gala stage set, a sparkling mosaic of red, white and blue. At night, gas lamps and electric lights and Venetian lanterns brought a rare cheering radiance to main streets and squares. Fireworks from six locations emblazoned and bombarded the sky. No one could take July 14, 1880 as just another day.’ (Pleasures of the Belle Epoque, Yale University, 1988, p. 3).\n\nTournes captures the collective energy ofthe vibrant holiday. He successfully employs a ground-level perspective to emphasise the density of the raucouscrowd, forcing the viewer into the scene. This dramatic viewpoint was perhaps influenced by the development of photography.Tournes also emphasises the mingling of many different Parisian social classes and genders, a pictorial technique which is a distinctly late 19th-century phenomenon linked with the advent of modern society.','France','Léon','Étienne Tournes',1855,1931,1,'',1),(136,'Swedish painter.

Born in Korea in 1936, Lee Ufan initially studied Oriental painting at Seoul National University before settling in Japan in 1956 where he majored in philosophy at Nihon University, Toyko. By the late 1960s, Lee emerged as the theoretical leader of Mono-ha (School of Objects), Japan’s first contemporary art movement to gain international recognition. Mono-ha surpassed modernism by rejecting Western notions of representation, expression and intervention, preferring to include unprocessed objects in work, while focusing on the relationship between materials used. \n\nThrough his creations, Lee questions the supreme role of the artist as main agent. His titles are limited to Relatum, From Point, From Line and Correspondence, all of which are based on the Mono-ha theory. Lee’s sculptures present arrangements of stones together with industrial materials like steel plates, rubber sheets and glass panes. In both his early painting series, From Point and From Line (1972-84) Lee applied repeated dots or lines – with a soft-haired brush used for Oriental painting – onto canvas used in Western painting. The result reveals the characters of pigments but does not apply paint to the surface as the artist would expect. \n\nIn 1991 Lee began his series of Correspondence paintings, which consist of just one or two grey-blue brushstrokes, made up of oil and crushed stone pigment, applied onto a large white surface. Paintings within this series vary in size from a few inches to ten feet per side and can take Lee up to a month to finish. He completes no more than 25 works a year.\nIn 1969 and 1973 Lee represented Korea in the São Paulo Biennal, but it was his Resonance exhibition at Palazzo Palumbo Fossati during the 2007 Venice Biennale that won him critical acclaim and an international audience.

Victor Vasarely was one of the leading figures in the development of geometrical abstraction known as Op Art, popular in Europe and the USA during the 1960s. He was born Vásárhelyi Gyözö in Pécs, Hungary, in 1908, and in 1925, after obtaining his bachelor’s degree, he briefly undertook medical studies at the Budapest University, which he abandoned two years later. He studied in Budapest at the Podolini-Volkmann Academy of Painting (1925-7) and under Alexander Bortnyk at the Mühely Academy, also known as the Budapest Bauhaus (1929-30). There Vasarely became aware of the formal and geometrical language that masters of the original Bauhaus (Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee and László Moholy-Nagy) had employed in their courses for artists and designers. Vasarely moved to Paris in 1930, working for the next decade as a commercial artist, mainly designing posters.\n\nIaca is a prime example of a piece from the period in which Vasarely painted primarily in black and white (1951-65) and where our eyes are presented with contradictory data as we read part of the field in terms of diagonals and other parts in terms of horizontals and verticals.\n\nVasarely’s work during the 1930s shows a sophisticated grasp of the techniques of applied art that can clearly be traced to his Bauhaus-style training, but he also began to display an interest in trompe-l’oeil effects, spatial illusions and graphic patterns incorporating zebras or chessboards. From 1944 Vasarely devoted himself exclusively to painting, holding his first one-man exhibition at the Galerie Denise René, Paris (see Provenance), in the same year. During the 1940s and 1950s Parisian art was dominated by Tachism, an abstract style more akin to American Expressionism in its abandonment of geometric abstraction in favour of a more intuitive form of expression. Vasarely instead decided to concentrate on constructive-geometric abstraction in 1947, a style first pioneered by artists such as Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich.\n\nVasarely’s repeated studies of specific environments, including the Breton island of Belle-Isle (1947), were designed to produce a new and rigorous system that could be applied universally by artists. He had realised that the use of illusory effects could transform the relatively stable structures preferred by earlier masters into shimmering and vibrant configurations that dazzled the eye of the spectator, even though their basis lay in simple abstract forms. The principle of optical illusion was first explored in black and white, employing a dialectic of geometrical shapes, after which Vasarely not only introduced colour but became particularly drawn to cellular structure and patterns of growth.\n\nVasarely largely pioneered the emerging style of Op Art in the 1950s with compositions based on a continual, aggressive interaction between different kinds of pattern; he invented a plastic alphabet of standardised colours and shapes which could be used in a wide range of permutations and would lend itself to endless reproduction. In the 1960s, Vasarely’s influence spread far wider, first through groups of younger artists such as the Parisian Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel (GRAV), as well as through the widespread diffusion of his designs by way of posters, fabric patterns and other images in mass circulation. He had his first New York show in 1964 at the Pace Gallery and in 1965, he participated in The Responsive Eye exhibition at the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), dedicated exclusively to Op Art. In the same year he was awarded the Grand Prix, jointly with Alberto Burri, at the São Paulo Biennial and one of four equal main prizes for painting at the 1967 Pittsburgh International Exhibition.\n\nAs well as designing screenprints and tapestries, Vasarely believed that his research could provide design prototypes for architectural and urban schemes on a vast scale and he completed several projects at sites such as the Gare Montparnasse, Paris. He also collaborated with architects in projects such as Caracas University, Venezula, which has one of his reliefs in aluminium, and the French Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal. Vasarely even devised a computer programme for the designing of his art, as well as a do-it-yourself kit for making Op Art paintings. \n\nIn 1976 his large kinematic object Georges Pompidou was installed in the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. \n\nIn 1976, ten years after its initial conception, the Fondation Vasarely near Aix-en-Provence was inaugurated. Treated as a monumental kinetic light sculpture the building was a thriving example of the synthesis between architecture and visual arts. In their plan, Vasarely and the prime architect Jean Sonnier opted for a cellular system consisting of 16 hexagons: a geometric shape that Vasarely combined repeatedly in his series Homage to the Hexagon. The Foundation has 5,000 square metres of floor space and houses 44 monumental pieces by the artist. \n\nVasarely died in Paris in 1997. His work continues to intrigue as was witnessed by a show of over 70 original works exhibited at the Musée en Herbe in Paris in 2012.','France','Victor','Vasarely',1906,1997,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Vasarely',1),(139,'Dutch painter. Born in 1898 in Lisse, The Netherlands, Geer (Gerardus) van Velde moved to The Hague in 1904 with his mother and siblings. At only 12 he became an apprentice designer, together with his elder brother, Bram, with Schaijk & Eduard H. Kramers. The brothers were encouraged to paint in their spare time by their employer. \n\nHaving served in the Red Cross during the First World War, Geer took a walking tour around Flanders, painting signs to earn a living. After visiting Bram in Paris in 1925, he decided to settle there, devoting himself to painting. Kramers continued to help both brothers financially until the effects of the Great Depression made it no longer viable. Geer acquired his own studio in 1926 and between 1928 and 1932 the van Veldes exhibited at the city’s annual Salon des Indépendants. In 1937 Geer met the Irish writer Samuel Beckett who became a lifelong friend and who often wrote texts to accompany Geer’s exhibitions.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful show at Guggenheim Jeune, London (1938), he moved to Cagnes-sur-Mer where he lived until 1944, working intensely. At this time Geer became more attracted to Cubism. He began his Intérieurs series, with a window-picture opening on to the sea through which he explored the inside-outside dialogue. The very specific light of the south of France had a definitive influence on Geer’s work, with soft, pastelly, often taupe tones invading the entire canvas. When he returned to Paris to live permanently at Cachan from 1944, the influence of the tender light of Ile-de-France continued to compliment these tones, as is illustrated in this Composition of 1951. The vigour yet gentleness of his paintings has been likened to that of the Impressionist-Cubist work of Jacques Villons. \n\nGeer met Dutch painter and exhibitor Piet Moget (see Provenance) in 1952 when the latter was living in Port-la-Nouvelle, southern France. This was the year in which Moget launched a series of exhibitions of other European artists; as well as Geer, these included such luminaries as de Staël, Poliakoff, Léger and Tanguy. Moget considered Geer van Velde as his ‘spiritual father’.\n\nHaving exhibited twice at the influential Galerie Maeght in Paris (solo and group shows, 1946-8), Geer van Velde and his brother Bram showed at the Kootz Gallery in New York through the intermediary of Maeght. Around this time the artist told French art critic Bernard Dorival, ‘The eye does not have all the rights; it must leave something to intuition and intelligence. I tend increasingly towards lyricism.’\n\nGeer participated annually in the Salon de Mai from 1949 to 1971, as well as selections for Amsterdam in 1961 and Tokyo in 1963. He also took part in the Salon Réalités Nouvelles, and in the Grands et jeunes d’aujourd’hui. He was invited to participate in École de Paris at the Galerie Charpentier in 1954, 1959 and 1960.\nNever abstract, Geer’s work, with its subtle, sometimes monochrome colours resembles a long meditation on light. In the catalogue of a major Geer van Velde Retrospective at Musée d’Art moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1982, Piet Moget recounted the way in which Geer worked, following his own explanations: ‘The artist prepared his canvas himself.

Maurice de Vlaminck’snature, character, tastes and way of life were in perfect harmony with the freedom, daring and violence of his painting. He was brought up in a musical environment: his father was a violin teacher and his mother a piano teacher. Growing up at Le Vésinet near Paris, from 1892 he began to take an interest in painting, although he also worked as a mechanic and became a racing cyclist. As a largely self-taught artist, Vlaminck freed colour from its purely descriptive function, using broad, turbulent brushstrokes in a kind of proto-Expressionism, but he very quickly graduated to the Fauvist style that he practised from 1904 to 1907.\n\nAfter meeting André Derain in 1900, Vlaminck shared a studio with him on the Île de Chatou, a suburb about nine miles (14 km) southwest of Paris, flanked on the east by the Seine. Working side by side, they produced some of their greatest works in the Fauve style. In fact, Chatou plays a key role in the history of Fauvist painting. The winter of 1907 had been especially cold and snowy, but in the present painting the earliest signs of spring are already indicated by the first green shoots pushing up among the piles of melting snow. Vlamnick’s sweeping strokes of green pigment, together with the red indications of the roofs in the distance, contrast with the white snow and the black trees trunks set in perspective. For Vlaminck, whose family had moved to Chatou from Paris in 1893, the Seine and its environs provided numerous subjects for his canvases.\n\nVlaminck’s first exhibited works were in a group show at the Berthe Weill gallery, Paris, in 1904, followed by four canvases at the 1905 Salon des Indépendants and eight paintings in the Salon d’Automne that same year. It was in the last exhibition that he and other artists, including Henri Matisse and André Derain, were derisively labelled Fauves (wild beasts). Similarities in the work produced during these years by Derain and Vlaminck in particular were not coincidental, since they had shared the same studio and often painted scenes depicting their immediate surroundings. Vlaminck’s boldest paintings of the period include his Portrait of Derain in which the face is vermilion, the Restaurant de la Machine à Bougival (circa 1905; Paris, Musée d’Orsay) and The Red Trees (1906; Paris,Pompidou).\n\nThe impact on Vlaminck of the Vincent van Gogh exhibition of 1901, where he was introduced to Matisse by Derain, was succeeded in 1907 by that of the Paul Cézanne retrospective. In response to these stimuli, Vlaminck moved away from his use of colour towards a concern with structure. At the same time he developed a dramatic view of landscape that was to remain a hallmark of his work. Vlaminck remained consistently hostile to Cubism, instead developing a more naturalistic treatment of landscape, retaining his vigorous style but using more austere colours. \n\nFrom 1917 at Valmondois in northern France, where Vlaminck bought a house, he painted canvases that summarised his whole way of seeing. They show his favourite subjects under a violent light: a road, a few houses, trees tossed in the wind. The same country roads appear repeatedly in his paintings, executed in IÎe-de-France and later in the Perche region. Loading his skies with the threat of a storm or a tempest, Vlaminck’s painting of the period can be characterised as landscape Expressionism,with the repetition of these effects eventually became somewhat theatrical and melodramatic. This dramatic representation of nature was also evident in his equally vehement use of gouache, watercolour, ink and etching techniques.','France','Maurice','de Vlaminck',1876,1958,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_de_Vlaminck',1),(141,'French painter. Brought up in Paris in modest circumstances, Édouard Vuillard attended the Lycée Condorcet where his contemporaries included the musician Pierre Hermant and the writer Pierre Véber, as well as Maurice Denis. His closest friend was Ker-Xavier Roussel, and, on leaving school in 1885, Roussel encouraged Vuillard to join him at the studio of the painter Diogène Maillart, where they received the rudiments of artistic training. Vuillard began to frequent the Louvre and soon determined on an artistic career, breaking the family tradition of a career in the army.\nIn March 1886 Vuillard entered the Académie Julian in Paris where he was taught by Tony Robert-Fleury, and on his third attempt in July 1887 he passed the entrance examination to the École des Beaux-Arts. He was taught by Jean-Léon Gérôme for a brief period of about six weeks in 1888, but his studies were spasmodic. In 1889 Vuillard was persuaded by Maurice Denis to join a small dissident group of art students that referred to itself as the brotherhood of Nabis. Paul Sérusier the French painter who founded the Nabis group with Denis, Bonnard, Vuillard and othershad communicated to his fellow artists his knowledge of the Synthetist method of painting; this entailed a reliance on memory and imagination rather than direct observation, and the application of forms and colours reduced to their simplest as equivalents to sensations and emotions received from nature. At first Vuillard was reluctant to accept the idea that the painter should not seek to reproduce realistically what he saw, although during 1890 he made his first bold experiments in Synthetist painting. His most important series of colour lithographs, Landscapes and Interiors, was published in 1899. After 1914 he exhibited infrequently and his subsequent works remained largely unknown until 1938, the time of his retrospective exhibition at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs. Vuillard died at la Baule, in western France in 1940, while escaping from the German invasion.','France','Edouard','Vuillard',1868,1940,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuillard',1),(142,'Painter, film director, novelist, and playwright. Peter Weiss was born near Berlin and was forced to flee Germany with his family in 1934 because of Nazi persecution. The family settled temporarily in London, Switzerland, and Czechoslovakia before finally adopting Sweden as their new homeland in 1939.\nWeiss studied at several institutions including the Polytechnic School of Photography in London and the Art Academy in Stockholm before beginning his career as a writer and painter. His first art exhibition took place in 1936, and his first produced play was Der Turm(The Tower)of 1950. He joined the Swedish Experimental Film Studio in 1952 and made films with a decidedly Surrealistic influence. During this period, he also taught painting at Stockholm’s People’s University.','Germany','Peter','Weiss',1916,1982,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Weiss',1),(143,'Swedish painter. Petter Zennström was born in Stockholm but lives and works in Västerljung. He was educated at the Kungliga Konsthögskolan, Stockholm, from 1971 until 1976. During the 1970s Zennström became known for his black-and-white wood engravings. The work was angry and aggressive; words and images combined in order to channel anger at the world’s political, economic and social injustices. The artist once said, ‘I live in the belly of the beast, in the midst of welfare’, and his early art aired his fury with unjustly distributed resources and political violations.\n\nZennström’s oeuvre challenges the opinions and norms of contemporary social society. The works combine figuration with bold abstraction and elements of Pop Art so prevalent in America during the 1960s. His art took a new direction in the 1980s with the use of intense colour combinations leading to a greater degree of abstraction. One of the works from this period, The Secret (1981), was acquired by the Moderna Museet, Stockholm. \n\nDuring the 1980s and the 1990s Zennström developed his painting and his distinctive and unique imagery. Strong colours and organic forms expanded over the surface of the image and the paintings moved from the figurative to the abstract. The paintings no longer commented on a specific political or ideological conflict, but rather related to them. Hidden in the painting, on an implicit level, there is an examination of contemporary life, which is at times difficult to come to terms with. With time, the form of the painting has come to dominate over the explicit message and there is a desire for beauty in colour and shapes. In later works, the paintings have their origin in one of two fundamental forms: the upside down and the mirrored image. The colours are no longer the earlier, bright primary colours but rather a more dull range of brown shades.\n\nZennström’s work reveals, concerns and upsets. His motifs show an artist with a strong and sincere commitment against social, political and economic injustice. The work creeps under the skin of the viewer thanks to the tense mood and the black humour. More recently, the direct political and ideological references have given way to a more implicit agenda and a stronger abstract imagery. The works do, nonetheless, still hold references to a world order that is rarely pleasant, but important, both emotionally and intellectually. \n\nZennström has exhibited widely in both Sweden and abroad. He is represented in Sweden at, among others, Moderna Museet, Stockholm, the National Museum, Stockholm, Borås Konstmuseum, Göteborgs Konstmuseum, Moderna Museet, Malmö, Norrköpings Museum, Samtidsmuseet i Oslo, Sundsvalls Museum and the Kalmar Konstmuseum.','Sweden','Petter','Zennström',1945,-1,1,'',1),(144,'Swedish mixed-media artist. Nisse Zetterberg was born in Stockholm, 1910, into an artistic family: his father was a painter (Albert Zetterberg, 1883-1955), and his brother, born a year earlier, became an architect (Olle Zetterberg). Initially he learnt painting with his father, then studied at the College of Art, Stockholm (1929-34), under the varied tutelage of artist, writer and cartoonist Albert Engström, painter and printmaker Olle Hjortzberg and modernist painter Birger Simonsson. This paid off: Zetterberg worked primarily in painting and printmaking, but also in sculpture and decorative work, taking note of the current practices used in countries that he visited, including France, Holland, Belgium and England. \nZetterberg is perhaps most famous for his mixed-media work at Rinkeby subway station, Stockholm, which opened in 1975 and was supplemented in 1985. Capitalising on the runestone-rich area surrounding Stockholm, Zetterberg created, within rust-red rock walls, glistening gold mosaics of local finds excavated from Viking times. The other two artists involved in the station’s decor were Sven Sahlberg, whose large sun of gold with petals of oars hangs from the ceiling, and Lennart Grams, whose paintings of birds flying in the direction of the trains, adorn the track wall. \n\nOther public artworks by Zetterberg are included in Malmö City Library, a bank in Köping, the chancel windows in Torsåkers Church near Uppsala (1965) and a decorative frieze in Åvaskolan, Täby (1973).','Sweden','Nisse','Zetterberg',1910,1986,1,'',1),(145,'Swedish painter, etcher and sculptor. Anders Zorn was brought up by his grandparents at Mora. As he displayed a precocious talent for drawing he was admitted to the preparatory class of the Kungliga Akademien för de Fria Konsterna, Stockholm, at the age of 15. Dissatisfied with the outdated teaching and discipline of the Academy and encouraged by his early success as a painter of watercolour portraits and genre scenes (e.g. Old Woman from Mora, 1879; Zorn Museum, Mora), Zorn left the Academy in 1881 to try to establish an international career. He later resided mainly in London but also travelled extensively in Italy, France, Spain, Algeria and the Balkans and visited Constantinople. However, he continued to spend most of his summers in Sweden.\n\nSommarnöje was paintedat Dalarö in the archipelago outside Stockholm. This had been a very popular and picturesque summer residence since the end of the 19thcentury. Dalarö was an important place for Anders and Emma Zorn, Emma’s family rented a house here during the summer months from the coastal pilot Carl Gustav Dahlström – the man depicted in the boat. Emma and Anders married in 1885 and went to Dalarö at the beginning of the summer of 1886. Zorn found his inspiration and motifs in the surrounding environment and created several of his masterpieces here including Sommarnöje. \n\nDuring 1887-8 Zorn turned to oil painting, settling in Paris, where he remained until 1896. Here he began to gain international recognition thanks partly to his portraits and partly to his pictures of nudes (Une Première, 1888; Stockholm, National Museum, and Out of Doors, 1888; Göteborg, Konstmuseum). Zorn adopted the innovative practice of painting nudes en plein air. The virtuoso technique that he had developed in his watercolours was to some extent carried over to his oil paintings, where the broad, free handling of the brush illustrates his admiration for Edouard Manet. During the 1890s his work displayed an increasingly strong feeling for the body’s plasticity, reminiscent of Auguste Renoir. However Zorn, like Sargent and his good friend Max Liebermann (whose portrait Zorn painted in 1891; Zorn Museum, Mora), belonged to the moderate Modernist phalanx who adopted features not only from Impressionism and Japonisme but also from the fashionable art of the Salon. Zorn was also inspired by the Old Masters that he studied in the Louvre, particularly Titian, Velázquez and Rembrandt.\n\nIt was primarily his skill as a portrait painter that gained Zorn international acclaim. His incisive ability to depict the individual character of his model is, for example, apparent in portraits of prominent cultural personalities such as Antonin Proust (1888, private collection) and Coquelin Cadet (1889, Nationalmuseum Stockholm). The model’s surroundings were important; Zorn believed that a portrait should be painted in an environment that was natural for the model. An artificial studio environment was not to his taste. The international esteem Zorn received was not based solely on his paintings but on his exquisite etchings as well. He had worked with this technique since 1882 and produced 289 etchings, a number of which are very well known, among them the portrait of Ernest Renan (1892), Auguste Rodin (1906) and the current example of August Strindberg. Zorn admired and collected the etched works of Rembrandt and considered him to be his artistic forefather in this particular medium.','Sweden','Anders','Zorn',1860,1920,1,'',1),(146,'Swedish painter.

Turner, is one of the most important British landscape painters of the early 19th century. Known as a great naturalist, Constable preferred to paint the places he knew well and as such started out as an amateur with depictions of the Suffolk countryside near the River Stour. He was born the second son of Golding Constable, a miller, merchant and gentleman farmer at East Bergholt, Suffolk. By 1799 he was studying at the Royal Academy Schools training, as was the custom, as a history rather than landscape painter. Returning to Bergholt in 1802, Constable was determined to represent nature via local country scenes with the strong belief that there was ‘room enough for natural peinture’. The results were stunning oil studies of Stour Valley landscapes such as Dedham Vale, Evening (1802; London, V&A). This was the year he first exhibited at the Royal Academy. \n\nConstable is known to have stayed in Epsom with his uncle James Gubbins in 1806 producing en plein-air oil sketches of the Common and surrounding countryside in August. Immediately after this he visited the Lake District, an area that deeply impressed him and lead to a multitude of graphite and watercolour mountain studies, but only a few depicted in oil. Constable stayed in Epsom again in the summer of 1809 and other known oil sketches date from that visit (e.g. View atEpsom, 1809, London, Tate). By 1810 Constable’s commitment to his native surroundings revealed an adventurous use of colour, an admired variety of brushstroke and detail of individual motifs within a scene. His style reached its maturity in 1821 with his use of colour washed over a graphite underdrawing. As can be seen in Pond and Cottages: A Storm Approaching (1821; London, British Museum) chiaroscuro ¬¬– the distribution of light and dark masses in a picture – was becoming the formative basis of his art. From 1814 Constable insisted on painting oils for exhibition directly from nature, usually into a sketchbook (1814; London, V&A). He only discarded this methodwhen his canvasses stretched to 1.8 metres for the canal scenes of 1821-2. By the 1830s Constable was creating extraordinary, expressionistic oils, using his now preferred palette knife, as well as slashes, slabs and dribbles of often pure colour.','England','John','Constable',1776,1837,1,'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Constable',1),(170,'Portuguese-born French painter. Having arrived in Paris from Lisbon in 1928, a talented Marie-Hélène Vieira da Silva studieda diverse range of art: initially it was sculpture with Emile-Antoine Bourdelle and then with Charles Despiau; the following year she began engraving in Stanley William Hayter’s Atelier 17, before designing carpets for Dolly Chareau’s Art Deco interiors. The work of Joaquín Torres García (1874-1949), Uruguayan artist and theorist who was also living in Paris at this time, became an influence. He formed part of a future group Cercle et Carré (Circle and Square), promoter of the first exhibition of Constructivist and abstract art in Paris in 1930. This was the year Vieira da Silva married Hungarian artist Árpád Szènes. \n\nBy 1933 Vieira da Silva had exhibited in the highly respected Galerie Jeanne Bucher and in 1937 she had a second show there where her distinctive style using the diamonds and squares of Portuguese azulejos (tin-glazed ceramic tilework) combined with allusions to chessboards and card gamesbegan to come to the fore (e.g.Chess Game, 1943; Paris, Pompidou). \n\nVieiradaSilva’s subject matter became more strongly political prior to and during World War II as is evident in works such as Flags (1939; Düsseldorf, Kstsamml. Nordrhein-Westfalen), Disaster (War) (1941-2) and Liberation of Paris (1945). She and Szènes fled first to Portugal, then to Rio de Janeiro, where the couple mixed with the Brazilian intelligentsia. On their return to Paris, VieiradaSilva continued toexhibit at the Galerie Jeanne Bucher, displaying her grey palette yet citing the more colourful landscape Impressionists Jean Bazaine and Alfred Manessier, as well as the structural designs of Gustave Eiffel, as influences. \n\nThe Árpád Szènes-Vieira da Silva Foundation in Lisbon, inaugurated in 1994, houses a museum that features both artists’ works.','Portugal','M. H. Vieira','da Silva',1908,1992,1,'',1),(171,'Swedish painter. Petter Zennström was born in Stockholm but lives and works in Västerljung. He was educated at the Kungliga Konsthögskolan, Stockholm, from 1971 until 1976. During the 1970s Zennström became known for his black-and-white wood engravings. The work was angry and aggressive; words and images combined in order to channel anger at the world’s political, economic and social injustices. The artist once said, ‘I live in the belly of the beast, in the midst of welfare’, and his early art aired his fury with unjustly distributed resources and political violations.\n\nZennström’s oeuvre challenges the opinions and norms of contemporary social society. The works combine figuration with bold abstraction and elements of Pop Art so prevalent in America during the 1960s. His art took a new direction in the 1980s with the use of intense colour combinations leading to a greater degree of abstraction. One of the works from this period, The Secret (1981), was acquired by the Moderna Museet, Stockholm. \n\nDuring the 1980s and the 1990s Zennström developed his painting and his distinctive and unique imagery. Strong colours and organic forms expanded over the surface of the image and the paintings moved from the figurative to the abstract. The paintings no longer commented on a specific political or ideological conflict, but rather related to them. Hidden in the painting, on an implicit level, there is an examination of contemporary life, which is at times difficult to come to terms with. With time, the form of the painting has come to dominate over the explicit message and there is a desire for beauty in colour and shapes. In later works, the paintings have their origin in one of two fundamental forms: the upside down and the mirrored image. The colours are no longer the earlier, bright primary colours but rather a more dull range of brown shades.\n\nZennström’s work reveals, concerns and upsets. His motifs show an artist with a strong and sincere commitment against social, political and economic injustice. The work creeps under the skin of the viewer thanks to the tense mood and the black humour. More recently, the direct political and ideological references have given way to a more implicit agenda and a stronger abstract imagery. The works do, nonetheless, still hold references to a world order that is rarely pleasant, but important, both emotionally and intellectually. \n\nZennström has exhibited widely in both Sweden and abroad. He is represented in Sweden at, among others, Moderna Museet, Stockholm, the National Museum, Stockholm, Borås Konstmuseum, Göteborgs Konstmuseum, Moderna Museet, Malmö, Norrköpings Museum, Samtidsmuseet i Oslo, Sundsvalls Museum and the Kalmar Konstmuseum.','Australia','Margaret','Boko',-1,-1,1,'',1),(172,'Swedish painter.

At this time both Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc were of great importance to his development of an abstracted style combined with use of deep, glowing colours. In 1916 he moved to Stockholm where he developed his own style of expressive Cubism (e.g. Sailors’ War Dream, 1917; Malmö Konstmuseum).

In his designs for ballet costumes as much as his paintings, Adrian-Nilsson was much influenced by Léger, his studio neighbour in Montparnasse.

Aguéli only painted in two discrete periods: the first from 1890 to 1895; the second from 1911 until his death in 1917. In the interim, Aguéli led a nomadic existence in France and in the Far East, where he studied religion and Sufism, before converting to Islam in 1898. In 1900 he shot and wounded a banderillero at a bullfight in Paris in protest against cruelty to animals. \n\nIn the autumn of 1894 he went to Egypt and began painting intensively, producing such works as Egyptian Landscape (1894/5; Stockholm, Nationalmuseum). From 1902 to 1909 he lived in Egypt, working as a newspaper editor and for the most part neglecting art. Travelling to Paris in 1910 he became interested in Cubism and met Pablo Picasso and Fernand Léger. He took up painting again in Stockholm the following year, concentrating on figurative compositions with such works as Standing Female Model (1911; Stockholm, Nationalmuseum) and portraits such as this elegant example of a woman in profile. He became an art critic upon his return to Paris in 1912. By 1916 Aguéli was totally deaf.

Alechinsky was fascinated by anything related to printmaking and continually experimented with new ideas; in Seismographic Armful (lithograph with logogram, 1972; New York, Guggenheim) he collaborated with Dotremont who created the logogram which Alechinsky surrounded with his characteristic border.','Te Voir Marcher est un Événement Énorme',1901,'1901','Signed ‘GAN’ and dated ‘28.

Born in Ghana in 1944, El Anatsui now lives and works in Nigeria. El Anatsui’s work often makes use of found objects, however his practice is concerned with transforming rather than merely recycling or salvaging and so seeks meaning in the ways everyday materials can be repurposed to make statements about history, culture and memory.\n\nInitially El Anatsui worked with wood and ceramic. In 1978 he began his Broken Pots series, where works were made of shards fused together with a form of cement. Making art historical references to Nok terracotta sculptures, West African myths concerning the earth and cultural references to clay use, Anatsui’s ceramic sculptures speak of regeneration through memory and the piecing together of shattered ideas and histories to form a new whole. In 2002 he started working with discarded liquor bottle tops, the medium of Healer (shown here). Using thousands of these tops, each one is flattened, punctured and then stitched together with copper wire to form vibrant hanging ‘cloths’ or sculptures. The finished work appears to transform a rigid, metal material into something that looks malleable and luxurious. Its construction also means that each time it is hung it takes on a slightly different sculptural form through a changing of folds and creases – this is something which appeals to El Anatsui. Ghana is home to some of the most diverse and vibrant traditions of textile production and El Anatsui is very aware of the symbolic and signifying potential of cloth. He has said, ‘Cloth is to the African what monuments are to Westerners...Their capacity and application to commemorate events, issues, persons and objectives outside of themselves are so immense (2005; London, October). Healer, with its complex patterns, stunning colours and geometric shapes is reminiscent of traditional kente cloth of the Ashanti people of Ghana. A further level of meaning is brought to this work by its being made from gin and whisky bottle tops, the hard spirits whose destructive qualities have often plagued societies. Added to this, gin largely replaced cowries as the common currency in Lagos in the 19thcentury and its possession conferred social status.\n\nAnatsui’s work was brought to pre-eminence by the 2005 exhibition Africa Remix: Contemporary Art of a Continent,and one of the works was draped across the Palazzo Fortuny at the 52nd Venice Biennale in 2007.

From 1940 to 1943 he studied at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam, where he became friendly with Pierre Corneille. His earliest works recalled the painting of George Hendrik Breitner; during World War II, however, he began to paint with a more vigorous palette, with a clear interest in German Expressionism and above all in the work of Vincent van Gogh. There was a turning point in Appel’s style from about 1945 when he found inspiration in the art of the École de Paris and in particular of Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, whose exemplary bold shapes and freeform brushstrokes are discernible in this 1951 canvas of Birds in Flight, which also displays some Surrealist tendencies.

The contacts resulting from this movement, especially with the Danish members of the group, encouraged Appel to continue in the Primitivistic vein upon which he had already embarked. His most important source of inspiration during this period was emphatically children’s art and, from 1947, his completely personal, brightly coloured universe of simple, childlike beings and friendly animals began to populate his gouaches, oil pastel drawings, painted wood sculptures, and, gradually, oil paintings.

In his next series, the Gait of Objects, from 1958, he took his rejection of the subjectivity of the personal mark by throwing inked objects against the canvas.\n\nArman’s willingness to embrace chance was indicated by his decision in 1958 to change his name in accordance with a printing error, having already stopped using his surname, Fernandez, in 1947.

Kenneth Armitage was born in 1916, attended Leeds College of Art (1934-7) and on a scholarship to study at the Slade School of Fine Art, London (1937-9). In World War II he served in the British Army, and between 1946 and 1956 was Head of Sculpture at Bath Academy of Art; he also held a Gregory Fellowship in sculpture at Leeds University (1953-5). Armitage’s first works were carved in stone, in emulation of Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth, but in the post-war years he modelled with plaster on metal armatures, then cast in bronze. Flat Standing Figure was one of four pieces Armitage elected to exhibit at the Venice Biennale in 1952. It was shown beside those by other young British sculptors whose work signalled a new, anti-monumental, Expressionist approach, including Reg Butler, Lynn Chadwick, Eduardo Paolozzi and William Turnbull. This exhibition was a sell-out, propelling Armitage from a relative unknown to an internationally recognised artist in weeks. His purchasers included Peggy Guggenheim, Italian fashion designer Madame Schiaparelli and the Museums of Modern Art in New York and Rome.Armitage created small-scale figures, full of droll humour, with broad, flattened bodies, pinheads and sprouting, stick-like limbs. But Flat Standing Figure differs from other sculptures of this period, in that it evokes a sense of complete stillness. Like his contemporaries, Roger Hilton and William Scott, he approached the figure with a distinctly Modernist aesthetic. At that time, all three artists were absorbed with the simplification and abstraction of the human figure. The linear simplicity of Flat Standing Figure belies its formal complexity. Armitage plays with the traditional notion of sculpture as something voluminous or three dimensional. When viewed from the front, its apparent bulk promises a substantial form, yet the incredibly thin profile encourages one to simultaneously read the form as a silhouette. \n\nFlat Standing Figure (in other casts) has appeared in the following exhibitions: Kenneth Armitage & William Scott, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam (1959); Kenneth Armitage, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London (1959); Kenneth Armitage: 60 Years of Sculpture and Drawing, Jonathan Clark, London (2001).\n\nArmitage’s first solo exhibitions were held at Gimpel Fils, London (1952), and at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery, New York (1954). In 1955-7 he changed to working in clay, and in the 1960s he employed wax, resins and aluminium, and his pieces became darker in mood and more abstract. During the late 1960s and early 1970s he made a series of disembodied limbs and ‘furniture-figures’. He also experimented with drawn, screen-printed and photographic figural images on three-dimensional surfaces. Between 1975 and 1986 he moved from the figure to nature in his series of sculptures and drawings of oak trees in Richmond Park, London.

After being born in Berlin, Auerbach was sent to England in 1939 and moved from school in Kent to London in 1947, where he attended art classes at Hampstead Garden Suburb Institute and began acting in fringe theatre. From 1947 to 1948 he studied at Borough Polytechnic under David Bomberg, whose teaching was especially valuable in its emphasis on risk and on seeking organic, unified forms. Auerbach continued in Bomberg’s evening life classes while at St Martin’s School of Art, London (1948-52). He considered his first original achievement to have been Summer Building Site of a scene at Earls Court; this was rather geometric and painted in formal, prismatic colour, but much of his early work was thickly and laboriously impastoed in earth colours, as is thisHead of E.O.W, a portrait of one of his regular models, Estella West (other versions of which are at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio; the Tate, London and the National Gallery of Scotland). He studied from 1952 to 1955 at the Royal College of Art, London and had his debut exhibition at the Beaux Arts Gallery, London, in 1956.\n\nThe subjects and intentions of Auerbach’s paintings remained consistent. When he moved to his studio in Camden Town in 1954, he began recording such locations as Primrose Hill, which was close enough to observe and draw each morning before returning to paint indoors. For his portraits he always found it most challenging to take as his subject a person he knew well. At first he laid brushstrokes on top of one another, whereas from the late 1960s he scraped down the impasto after each session; as a final step he allowed the relatively soft paint to form spontaneously a geography of peaks, channels and merged colours, corresponding to facts and feelings about the subject. \n\nAfter returning to large portrait drawings in charcoal in the mid-1970s, Auerbach found a way of simulating living, solid subjects and translucent spaces by drawing in oil. The inventive conjunctions of mixed neutral tones and decisive primary marks became more plastic and resonant than before, and more responsive to random incidents. Articulate about his own art and his responses to other painters, Auerbach claimed to work from inside his pictures. He stated: “My motives are among the most common: the wish to retrieve a shameful life by making something and the wish to defeat the passing of time by preserving an experience. However, whatever the impulse, whatever the critical decision and consideration, at the moment of making, the work must arise as a living thing, with its own imperatives, under the artist’s hand.”','Expansion',1919,'1919','Signed ‘GAN’ and dated ‘28.

In 1934 Bacon held a one-man show in London which attracted the notice of the critic Herbert Read but, discouraged by commercial failure, he virtually ceased painting until 1945 when his strikingly original triptych, Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (London, Tate), won him fame and notoriety. He then committed himself to painting and famously destroyed most of his early work.\n\nThroughout his career Bacon drew upon an eclectic mixture of sources ranging from Rembrandt van Rijn to Diego Velázquez, the latter inspiring his Screaming Pope series of the early 1950s. He was also influenced by the time-lapse photography of Eadweard Muybridge and the films of Sergei Eisenstein, illustrated medical textbooks and newspapers. His highly original style incorporates elements of Surrealism and Expressionism and his deformed naked figures and anguished heads are usually contained within a characteristic scaffolding or inner frame. Bacon was a noted portraitist who preferred to work from photographs although his subjects were usually intimate friends. Aiming not for a likeness but an equivalent, his portraits, like that of Isabel Rawsthorne, are painfully distorted, powerful, and disturbing visions of life and death.\n\nDuring the 1950s Bacon’s reputation spread internationally and he was generally considered the greatest of modern British painters, unflinchingly revealing the essential loneliness and vulnerability of the human condition.

Beschey painted with delicate impasto, creating atmospheric blue-green distances and foregrounds enlivened with figures picked out in touches of clear red and blue. Village scenes and sets of landscapes representing the four seasons are favourite themes. \n\nWinter Landscape (shown here) is especially complex in composition and delicately painted. The miniaturist technique derives from Brueghel, while aspects of the painting – such as the trees dividing the composition – can also be found in the work of Jan’s elder brother, Pieter Brueghel the Younger (1564/5-1637/8). This landscape tradition descends directly from the superbly innovative landscapes of Pieter Breughel the Elder (circa 1525/30-69). Such was the prestige of this Flemish tradition that there was a ready market for paintings made in homage to the Brueghels well into the 18th century.\n\nThe beautifully observed figures in Beschey’s painting wear 17th-century dress. He depicts the pleasures and duties of winter: skaters, kolf players, wood gatherers, travellers in a heavy, covered wagon. White, grey and pale blue evoke the chill of the landscape. The delicate hues of the clothes – lilac, pea green, dusky pink, subtle ochres – make the foreground sparkle and lead the eye into the landscape. Boats are frozen into the ice, the windmill stilled. This delightful evocation of winter is a fresh and lively continuation of the Brueghel tradition.','Figure',1921,'1921','Signed lower right','18th Century',3200,'Oil on panel','Painted in Turin, Italy','1006','Edition 35/300',-1,2500,-1,73,88,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the UK','','',NULL,13,1,26,1,1),(27,'Danish painter. Ola Billgren was born in Copenhagen in January, 1940. His parents, Hans Billgren and Grete Lützhöft-Billgren, were both painters so he was largely trained at home. At the age of 13 he began to exhibit watercolours and ink drawings locally in Österlen in Skåne, Sweden where the family had moved in 1940. A trip to Spain in 1958 had a decisive impact on his later production. Having settled in Lund in 1960, he participated in a number of group shows where he demonstrated a lyrical, abstract painting style.\n\nEarly in 1963 he deserted the abstract and embarked on a photorealist course. His breakthrough followed shortly after with an exhibition at Galleri Karlsson in Stockholm in 1966. During the 1970s, Billgren’s work gradually evolved towards Colourism with overtones of Romantic painting. Two exhibitions at Galleri Engström in Stockholm in 1982 and 1983 testify to the result of this process, in which collage, among other art forms, plays an important role. In addition to painting, Billgren has devoted considerable time to graphics, collage and watercolours. (He increasingly worked with pure photography and he produced a short film, Ill Wind). He has also designed the sets for plays by Samuel Beckett and Marguerite Duras at Malmö Stadsteater.\n\nBillgren began contributing to art magazines and newspapers in the 1960s and has been associated with the cultural pages of the Sydsvenska Dagbladet for several years.

Ivan Black was born in London in 1972 and studied at Middlesex University. His interest in sculpture began at an early age and motion quickly became central to his work, adding, as he saw it, another dimension of complexity and interest to his experiments. An inherent problem solver, he spent his early years amassing multi-disciplinary skills in pursuit of realising his ambitious ideas.\n\nBlack’s current work uses his unique methodology to create kinetic forms that mutate upon the introduction of energy. The repetition of identical elements is a recurrent theme in his work; by this means he builds complex, fluid structures. Each sculpture is a section of a potentially continuous sequence, generated in form by the application of systematic rules to his geometry.\n\nTaking inspiration for his designs from iconic natural geometry (e.g. the DNA helix; movement of celestial bodies through space; sound and light waves), and combining these with mathematical concepts and the pioneering spirit of the British engineer, Black creates a synergy between art, science and technology. His meticulously engineered and seamlessly integrated mechanisms are central to the behaviour and appeal of his work. Tending towards the Minimalist in design, the movement is allowed to take centre stage.\n\nBlack’s work has been exhibited in galleries worldwide, including the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice, The Cass Sculpture Foundation, Goodwood, West Sussex, Flowers Gallery, London, Interart Sculpture Park, The Netherlands, Palmyra Sculpture Centre, Mallorca and the Hannah Peschar Sculpture Garden, Surrey.

While still a student Blake began producing paintings that openly testified to his love of popular entertainment and the ephemera of modern life. Blake displayed his nostalgia for dying traditions not only through his preference for circus imagery, but also by artificially weathering the irregular wooden panels on which he was then painting. His respect for fairground art, barge painting, tattooing, commercial art, illustration and other forms of image-making rooted in folkloric traditions led him to produce some of the first works to which the term Pop Art was later applied.\n\nFrom the late 1950s, however, he also produced works far more radical in conception by eliminating the personal touch. Fine Art Bit (1959; London, Tate), Got a Girl (1960-1; University of Manchester, Whitworth Art Gallery) and Toy Shop (1962; London, Tate) typify the collage paintings and constructions composed only of patterns of bright colour and of ready-made materials such as postcards, photographs, book illustrations, toys and other objects, and brutally presented without mediation. The acts of selection and retrieval in these works, generally made in alliance with references to pop music and mass entertainment, including Hollywood films, wrestling, pin-ups and strip-tease, are presented as equivalent to the painstaking recording of observations. He would use imagery, like that of Marilyn Monroe, which would later become the hallmarks of American Pop Art. To the general public, however, he remains best known as the designer of the record cover for Sgt.

Boldini decorated a room at their villa, La Falconiera, near Pistoia, with the only mural paintings of his career, first displaying the grand manner and dynamism that was to become characteristic of his art.In 1870 and 1871 Boldini travelled to London as a guest of William Cornwallis-West, a friend of the Falconers. He was inspired by the great 18thcentury English portrait painters and was also impressed with Joseph Mallord William Turner’s work.\n\nSettling in Paris in 1871, Boldini soon became a celebrated artist, signing a contract with the art dealer Adolphe Goupil to paint landscapes and genre subjects that met the market’s demand for small, bright, lightly executed, 18thcentury costume pieces.Also popular were his views of Parisian life.In 1876 he travelled to Germany, where he met Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel, and to The Netherlands, where he admired the work of Frans Hals. Around this time Boldini began to paint portraits of beautiful society women, peculiar to which is the contrast between their carefully rendered and illuminated faces and the loosely painted, undefined surroundings.Boldini also found an affinity with Édouard Manet and established an enduring friendship with Edgar Degas.\n\nIn 1889 Boldini travelled with Degas to Spain, where they admired the work of Velázquez, and then to Morocco.In 1890, at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, he was inspired by the grand manner of Anders Zorn’s portraits. While continuing to paint still lifes, views of Venice, horses and portraits of women, often in provocative poses, Boldini specialised in portraits of the beautiful and the famous.By the end of the century, he was, along with John Singer Sargent, the most sought-after portrait painter in Paris.','Flat Standing Figure',1925,'1925','Signed in white crayon and numbered 22/130, published by ABCD Editions.

From the 1860s onwards, the art of Japanese woodblock printing, Uyiko-e, provided a source of inspiration to many of the Impressionist painters in Europe, giving rise to Japonisme. This coincided with a renewed interest in the art of printmaking. Surprisingly, the medium where this Japanese influence was most in evidence in the West was in lithography, not in woodcuts, and in printmaking the democratically minded Pierre Bonnard found that he could share the same image many times. The Japanese prints feature large expanses of colour and little attention was given to perspective or shadows; often figures in them were depicted as silhouettes, represented by these flat plains. Bonnard was also on the periphery of the Nabis movement, a group of artists who were both representational and decorative in their approach. They were on the one hand strongly influenced by the work of Paul Gauguin and on the other by the Impressionists. Much of Bonnard’s work, especially in his printmaking, was like that of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s, strongly affected by Art Nouveau.\n\nLa Petite Blanchisseuse depicts one of the thousands of Parisian women and girls employed by the laundry industry at that time, going about their daily business, just as the traditional Japanese prints had often featured solitary women carrying out mundane tasks. Like much of the work produced by the Nabis artists, it is painterly and non-realistic. Bonnard’s treatment of the figure is very flat, with little shadow, and the scene is whimsical, as can be seen in her posture, and especially in his addition of the dog. The artist has composed the work considering the medium carefully, and exploited the qualities of lithography. The colours used by the artist here are largely dull, reflecting the drab, industrial Paris of the time, but there are flashes of vibrancy in the red dog and the door, displaying Bonnard’s sense of the power of colour. It would be later that he would develop a brighter palette when he moved to the south of France in 1912. La Petite Blanchisseuse is part of a portfolio of 22 prints by various leading artists, published by the renowned Ambroise Vollard, entitled L’Album des Peintres-Graveurs.

It took fellow artist and compatriot Eric Hallström to convince Börje to take up painting as a career. They set up a joint studio on Kungsholmen, Lake Mälaren, and, by 1918, the two artists were showing at the Strandvägen art gallery of Arturo Ciacellis, a respected Italian Futurist, art dealer and Stockholm resident. Following many Swedish artists, Börje travelled to Italy after World War I and spent some time in the south of France as an Esther Lindahl Scholar. \n\nBörje started out as a naïvist, but during his stay in Italy he became influenced by early Italian art, adopting a refreshingly clear design and classical symmetry to his compositions, as can be seen in Village scene with fountain. \n\nDuring the 1930s much of Börje’s oeuvre was focused on Sweden’s northern landscapes.

As a youth in Medellín, Fernando Botero briefly attended a school for matadors, but soon took up painting, having been inspired by the pre-Columbian and Spanish colonial art that surrounded him, as well as by the political work of Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. His own works were first exhibited in 1948, and two years later he had his first one-man showin Bogotá. While studying painting in Madrid in the early 1950s, he made his living by copying paintings housed in the Prado Museum – particularly those of his idols at the time, Francisco de Goya and Diego Velázquez – and selling them to tourists. He spent much of the rest of the decade studying the art treasures of Paris and Florence.\n\nThroughout the 1950s Botero began experimenting with proportion and size. When he moved to New York City in 1960, he had developed his trademark style: the depiction of round, corpulent humans and animals. In these works he referenced Latin American folk art in his use of flat, bright colour and boldly outlined forms. The inflated proportions of his figures also suggest an element of political satire, perhaps hinting at the subjects’ overblown sense of their own importance. His other paintings from the period include bordello scenes and nudes, which possess comic qualities that challenge and satirise sexual mores, and portraits of families, which possess a gentle, affectionate quality.','Artwork one',1930,'1930','Signed lower left','20th Century',8600,'Bronze','Painted in Turin, Italy','60036','Edition 22/130',66,20100,-1,81,70,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the Italy','','Mat staining, pale stains in margins, minor defects alongside edges of sheet.',NULL,21,1,35,1,1),(36,'In 1973 Botero returned to Paris and began creating sculptures in addition to his works on canvas.

Around 1861 he encountered Camille Corot and Charles-François Daubigny, the former appropriately designating him ‘Le Roi des Cieux’ (‘The King of The Skies’).

When the Bugatti family moved to Paris around 1904, Rembrandt met the businessman, gallerist and foundry owner Adrien Hébrard, who was responsible for casting many of his sculptures. After gaining his initial exposure as an artist at the Venice Biennale and then winning the Grand Prix for sculpture in Milan in 1906,Bugatti moved to Antwerp in 1907,where the city zoo provided him with a studio in which to make his animal sculptures.

In 1874 Gustave Caillebotte was invited to take part in the First Impressionist Exhibition in the Nadar Gallery in Paris by Edgar Degas, who he had met at the house of their mutual friend Giuseppe de Nittis. Instead, Caillebotte made his debut in the Second Impressionist exhibition at Auguste Renoir’s initiation in 1876, showing eight paintings, including Floor-scrapers of 1875, his earliest masterpiece, now in the Musée d’Orsay, Paris. Caillebotte organised the Impressionist show of 1877 and made great efforts to restore cohesion to the group by persuading Claude Monet to exhibit in 1879. Having inherited a large fortune from his parents, Caillebotte gave assistance to his artist friends by purchasing their work and amassing a famous collection of Impressionist masterpieces that he left to the state. Although the bequest was only partially accepted on his death in 1894, it provoked numerous and violent protests but now forms the core of the collection at the Musée d’ Orsay.\n\nCaillebotte’s style is often said to belong to the school of Realism but it was strongly influenced by his Impressionist associates. Although the exact location of this picture is unknown, it is possible that Temps de Neige depicts a suburb such as Pontoise, Louveciennes or Argenteuil, all of which provided much inspiration for the snow scenes of Monet, Caillebotte, Camille Pissarro and Alfred Sisley at that time. Caillebotte used a high viewpoint, and the near-monochromatic tonality lends to the overall sense of isolation. This type of composition originated with the development of photography. Its design is influenced by the cropped photographic images which were popular among the Impressionists at the time. Disillusioned by disagreements that resulted in the breakup of the Impressionist group, Caillebotte took little part in Parisian artistic life after 1882. He settled in Petit-Gennevilliers near Argenteuil where, like Monet, he lavished much care on his garden, using it as a source for his later works.','Inspiration',1998,'1998','Signed in white crayon and numbered 22/130, published by ABCD Editions.

In 1923 he enrolled at the Art Students League in New York to produce oil paintings and in 1924 he became a freelance artist for the National Police Gazette,sketching sporting events and circus performances. In 1926, his first illustrated book, Animal Sketching was published, based on studies made at the Bronx and Central Park Zoos in New York.\n\nLater that year, Calder travelled to Paris, attending sketching classes at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. He was particularly influenced by the inventive collages of Joan Miró and by the mystical art of Paul Klee. In Paris, Calder made wood and wire animals with movable parts and designed the first pieces of his miniature Circus (1926-32; New York). Performances of this hand-operated circus helped to introduce Calder to the Parisian avant-garde and to potential patrons. From 1927-30 he constructed figures, animals and portrait heads in wire and carved similar subjects in wood. After visiting Piet Mondrian’s studio in 1930, Calder began to experiment with abstract constructions; invited to join Abstraction-Création in 1931, he was one of the few Americans to be actively involved in the group. In 1931 he exhibited his first non-objective construction, and in the following year he showed hand-cranked and motorised mobiles, marking the beginning of his development as a leading exponent of kinetic art. After an initial involvement with geometric elements and machine imagery, he introduced biomorphic forms into his kinetic sculptures. Both the painted constructions and the brightly coloured mobiles synthesised Constructivist methods and materials with abstract forms derived from Surrealist imagery.\n\nHe refined his wind-driven mobiles to produce elegant, space-encompassing abstractions of gracefully bending wires. During the 1960s and 1970s colossal stabiles were commissioned for public sites around the world, Calder’s arching forms, dynamic surfaces and biomorphic imagery complementing the geometric regularity and severity of modern architecture. In his mature years his production included paintings, drawings, prints, book illustrations, jewellery and tapestries, all of which were composed of bold, abstract elements and in primary colours. Shortly before his death, Calder completed a colossal stabile, La Défense, at the Rond Point de La Défense métro station in Paris.','Autotelic',1999,'1999','Signed in white crayon and numbered 21/130, published by ABCD Editions.

Luca Cambiaso (or Cambiasi, Cangiagio), born in Genoa, was known for his remarkable artistic imagination and a bold sense of design. Four known paintings of the Baptism of Christ have survived, allfrom ecclesiastic commissions. The painting which relates most closely to the composition of the present sheet was made for the church of Sta Chiara in San Martino d’Albaro in Genoa, circa 1570. The composition relies on the balance between the two main figures, whose actions and proportions are accentuated by geometric reduction of shapes, only the ink wash providing some concession to naturalism. The artist made relatively few preparatory drawings, focusing in on detailed studies of drapery, heads or limbs and modelletti, so any such occurrences are very rare.\n\nCambiaso started to develop his celebrated proto-Cubist, simplified anatomical drawings in the 1550s. Their function may have been no more than to speed up the design process for his compositions, much as Nicolas Poussin did nearly a century later, allowing him to explore the arrangement and balance of figures. The notion of reducing the human form to a series of geometric shapes had its origins in the German printed manuals of the early 16thcentury, such as that of Erhard Schön (circa 1491-1542), published in the 1530s. Cambiaso’s work was said by the contemporary art historian G.P. Lomazzo to belong to a specifically Lombard tradition, as opposed to the more naturalistic Tuscan and Emilian schools of draughtsmanship. Collectively they reflect Cambiaso’s important role in the development of Baroque drawing.','Paint on canvas',2000,'2000','Signed in white crayon and numbered 22/130, published by ABCD Editions.

Canaletto’s fame rests above all on his Venetian output, on his panoramic, brilliantly day-lit scenes looking across Saint Mark’s Square or the Grand Canal. While some of these paintings were purely topographical, others include scenes derived from festivals or ceremonial events. He also painted purely imaginary views (capriccios), although the demarcation between the real and the invented is never clear-cut. Canaletto was highly successful with the English, helped in this by the British consul, Joseph Smith, whose own large collection of Canaletto’s works was sold to King George III in 1762.

Through visual elements Carlsund tried to achieve an auditory effect; the contrapuntal music of Baroque composer J.S. Bach inspired him in this.\n\nIn 1929 Carlsund co-founded the pioneering Art Concret group in Paris with Theo van Doesburg, Jean Hélion, and the Armenian painter Leon Tutundjian, and in 1930 published their manifesto The Basis of Concrete Art in the first and only edition of Art Concret. The manifesto stated that, ‘The painting should be constructed entirely from purely plastic elements, that is to say planes and colours. A pictorial element has no other significance than itself and consequently the painting possesses no other significance than itself.’ Concrete art distinguished itself from abstract art in that it emanated directly from the imagination rather than from an abstraction of any form of nature. \nCarlsund experienced a creative crisis soon after the publication, preferring to write more and paint less. His radicalism continued through the written word, however: his art criticisms often met with opposition, although in later years they attracted greater interest.

César came from a working-class environment and spent his childhood in Marseille, where he studied from 1935 to 1943 at the city’sÉcole des Beaux-Arts under a sculptor who had worked as a stonecutter for Auguste Rodin. In 1943, on gaining admission to the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he completed his studies in 1950, he settled permanently in the capital, discovering the work of sculptors such as Constantin Brancusi, Alberto Giacometti and Germaine Richier; he was also impressed by the iron sculpture of Pablo Gargallo. César’s first sculptures, made of plaster and iron and dating from 1947-48, were of an academic style but in materials that consciously rejected the classical tradition. These were followed by works made of repoussé lead and soldered wire. Guided by a concern for economy, César assembled disparate elements including waste lead, copper pipe and other industrial metal scrap soldered or welded together so as to retain their rough appearance. In the first such sculptures, for example The Fish (1953-54; Paris, Pompidou), the human figures or animals thus formed revealed their method of construction in a threadlike lattice. César’s first one-man exhibition, in 1954, displayed the development of an entire bestiary of insects and distorted winged figures.\n\nFrom around 1956, César began to use metal in a form that appeared fuller and more solid, as in The Devil (1956; Paris, Pompidou), or sometimes as flat sheets, for example in Flat Sculpture (1958; London, Tate). He continued working in this style until 1965, favouring abstract reliefs but also concentrating on the human figure, as in the portrait of the writer Patrick Waldberg (1961-2; London, Tate), or combining the two in such a way as to reveal a clear debt to Classical sculpture in spite of his use of industrial materials, for example in The Other One’s Sister (1962; Otterlo, Kröller-Müller). By this stage César had a substantial international reputation, and he represented France at both the Venice Biennale (1956) and the São Paulo Biennal (1957). At the Salon de Mai in Paris in 1960,César created a scandal by exhibiting three large metal blocks made from compressed industrial scrap, mainly from cars, includingAutomobile Compression (1960; Geneva, Musée d’Art et d’Histoire). These ‘compressions’, as he called these sculptures ready-made from recycled materials, seemed the product of a destructive act, disrespectful of tradition, but they made possible the creation of new forms. The most spectacular new development in his work, however, concerned the Expansions, initiated in 1967 using polyurethane foam, whose elasticity and flexibility enabled him to conceive forms with undulating movements. The first of these was produced as a public performance, with the solidified material cut into pieces and distributed to the audience.','Head of Nothing',2004,'2004','Signed lower left','20th Century',0,'Polished Bronze','Painted in Turin, Italy','60054','Edition 117/150',-1,1800,-1,70,80,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave France','','Mat staining, pale stains in margins, minor defects alongside edges of sheet.',NULL,33,1,53,3,1),(54,'British sculptor.

These were generally based on insect and bird forms. Chadwick’s mobiles were exhibited at his first one-man show at the Gimpel Fils gallery in London in 1950 and this was followed by a commission to produce two sculptures for the Festival of Britain in 1951.

In 1953 he moved on to produce solid sculptures, creating works of a highly abstracted human form, executed in a novel technique. One of the first of these was Conjunction (1953; London, Tate), made from an iron rod cage filled with a material called Stolit, an artificial stone.

His tutor was Edwin Long who convinced the young painter to pursue art as a full-time career. In 1875 Clausen made a trip to Holland and Belgium where he became influenced by Dutch Naturalism at the Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp. After studying briefly under Professor Joseph Van Lerius (1823-76), he began to sketch in the fishing villages along the Dutch coast; the product of these studies, High Mass at a Fishing Village on the Zuyder Zee (1876; Nottingham, Castle Museum), was his first exhibit at the Belgian Royal Academy and was well received. In 1881 he married Agnes Webster and the couple settled in Berkshire. In 1882 Clausen left for France where he studied briefly at the Academie Julien in Paris. William Adolphe Bouguereau, the great French Salon artist, was his first tutor but Clausen soon became fascinated by the art of Jules Bastien Lepage, the Ruralist and plein-air painter. Closely identifying with English rural life, Clausen favoured Naturalism during this period as a technique of what he called ‘studied impartiality’, with its emphasis on literal representation rather than narrative content.\n\nOn returning to England,Clausen became a founder member of the New English Art Club (NEAC) and was the most widely respected of the NEAC painters, promoting the interests of the Glasgow Boys when they made their London debut at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1890. His works produced after 1891 demonstrate a greater interest in movement and atmosphere and echo Thomas Hardy in their presentation of the elemental qualities of English rural life. Clausen was widely regarded as the most popular professor at the Royal Academy of Arts in London since Joshua Reynolds and he was appointed an official war artist.

Towards the end of her life she became regarded largely as an abstractionist, but her work always retained a figurative base, as if form had been filtered through memory.\n\nDuring the 1950s she introduced plant motifs into her urban scenes as well as winches, cooling towers and gasometers, all of which combine in abstracted compositions such as the current Urban Landscape V, which was illustrated on the front cover of her Whitechapel exhibition in 1960.

Jean Cocteau was orn in Maisons-Laffitte, Yvelines, a village near Paris, in 1889, to a socially prominent family. He was largely self-taught, and a natural explorer of several artistic mediums. Although his imaginative poetry, films and experimental theatre gained him the greatest accolades, Cocteau’s work as a draughtsman and painter with its free, elegant style, was an important element in conceiving him as a catalyst for the cross-fertilisation of art forms. And between the wars this is what Paris, where Cocteau resided, made its name for.\nCocteau first gained notice as a poet in his twenties, with the publication of Le Prince frivole (1910). This was the year he met choreographer Serge Diaghilev, the Ballets Russes, Nijinsky and Stravinsky. After being commissioned by Diaghilev for poster designs, Cocteau was soon promoted. By 1912 he had written the storyline for his first ballet, Le Dieu bleu, staged by Diaghilev. The Diaghilev collaboration continued unabated with one of Cocteau’s most acclaimed theatre pieces theatre, Parade (1917). This avant-garde fusion of the arts involved a dream team comprising music by Erik Satie, sets/costumes by Pablo Picasso and choreography by Léonide Massine. Successful theatrical partnerships carried on, including Le Boeuf sur le toit (1920) and Les Mariés de la tour Eiffel (1921), as well as a libretto for Stravinsky’s opera Oedipus Rex (1927). \n\nCocteau’s work as a draughtsman was widely established through Le Coq et l’Arlequin (1918), an essay accompanied by line drawings that revealed his idiosyncratic approach to illustration. His love of opium during the 1920s didn’t affect the volume of his output, but rather induced a dream-like state of mind, as is evident in his book Opium (1930) containing 40 drawings and three collages, and in his 1926 exhibition of ‘plastic poetry’ (drawings, objects and collages). Cocteau’s unique form of outline drawing (some say rivalling Picasso in its elegant simplicity and vitality of line) continued in books including Soixante dessins pour ‘Les Enfants terribles’ (1935), and remained largely unchanged for the rest of his life.\n\nIt was his films which earned Cocteau the greatest regard visually. He made his first, Le Sang d’un poète, in 1930, with La Belle et la bête (1945), Orphée (1950) and Testament d’Orphée (1960) being the most successful others. In the late 1940s he transferred some of his late Cubist drawings to tapestries and produced sculptures and several capricious ceramics in the 1950s.

A childhood illness in 1918 forced him to stay in his room for several months, initiating a lifelong love of storytelling and dreams. He attended the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1930 to 1934, where he entered the intaglio engraving studio of Dezarrois. He qualified as a teacher in 1933, and in 1935 settled in Rennes where he became Professor of Art at the Lycée. Couy was mobilised in a tank battalion in 1939; he refused to take part in any artistic ventures during the Occupation. He returned to Paris in 1945 again becoming Professor of Art, this time at the Lycée Lakanal in Sceaux (1945-61). \nAs a painter, etcher and engraver, Couy represented nature from his imagination or childhood memories with a poetically charged simplicity. His works illustrated the succession of days and nights or seasons. In the 1950s he still depicted reality, but began to introduce elements of the abstraction, giving his work a new freedom and dream-like quality which transformed it beyond the natural.\nCouy took part in group exhibitions, including the Salon des Indépendants in Paris (1930-9), Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts and the Salon d’Automne (from 1935), as well as the Salon de la Jeune Gravure Contemporaine (from 1945).

Cragg is one of the most acclaimed artists of the so-called New British Sculpture generation that emerged from London art schools in the late 1970s, and which included Anish Kapoor, Barry Flanagan, Richard Long and Bill Woodrow, among others. \n\nThe manipulation of materials into forms and images that offer new experiences and insights lies at the heart of Tony Cragg’s sculptural practice. His outlook is marked by an interest in analysing the relations between materials, science and the body. This scientific method of analysis is not mathematical but organic, based on the interaction between the material and the human body. Cragg’s oeuvre centres around two bodies of research: Early Forms and Rational Beings. Cragg described the Early Forms as ‘forms changing along an axis bilaterally curved with a simple profile’. These works explore the possibilities of distortion based on everyday objects such as vases or bottles. As the artist moves, the material is moved too, resulting in a sort of three-dimensional morphing. The sculptures belonging to the body of Rational Beings start from the outlines of a human gesture or profile. Their principal development is vertical, emphasising their origin as anthropomorphic, an aspect continued in the recent works shown here, the Zig Zag Bronzes, which appear to be three figures conversing, twisting and constantly moving.\n\nCragg was elected as a Royal Academician in 1994 and in 1988won the Turner Prize. In October 2007 he was awarded the prestigious Praemium Imperiale for the significant impact his work has had on the field of sculpture.','Paint on canvas',1776,'1776','Signed in white crayon and numbered 22/130, published by ABCD Editions.

Nils von Dardel was born in Bettna, Södermanland, in 1888. After studying at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm, he was one of a group of young artists (including Sigrid Hjertén, Isaac Grünewald, Einar Jolin and Leander Engström) who went to Paris around 1910. He was influenced by the Post-Impressionists, the pure colours of the Fauvists and Japanese woodcuts. He also made some tentative attempts at Cubism using the subject of cityscapes.\nVon Dardel’s interest in Post-Impressionist tendencies, especially Pointillism, was expressed in strong, clear colours blended with a naïve style of storytelling. A typical example is Begravning i Senlis(Funeral in Senlis) from 1913, which he painted while staying in the small medieval town of Senlis. The human figure is the dominant motif in von Dardel’s works, noted,for example, in Den Döende Dandyn (The Dying Dandy) from 1918.\n\nIn 1913 von Dardel made friends with a fellow Swede, Rolf de Maré, who would later create the Ballets Suédois, which would perform in Paris in 1920-5. Von Dardel was not particularly well off, but he was imaginative and talented while de Maré was enthusiastic and had money. Together they were a very fruitful duo during the five eventful years of the dance company’s existence. In 1920 von Dardel produced the stage sets for the premiere piece Midsummer Wakeand for the pioneering dance drama Maison de Fous. The paintings from this period often recall stage sets; they are like sketches for a drama, or stills from a film in which the viewer assumes the role of author and director. Crime Passionnel (Crime of Passion) from 1921 is an example; vivid and even gory, while also echoing the artist’s hectic life in 1920s Paris. Von Darnel also collaborated with the subject of the painting shown here, Jacques Hébertot (1886-1970), a famous French theatre director, journalist and editor.\n\nVon Dardel led a self-destructive, itinerant and hectic life. Many of his later paintings are portraits of people he met on his travels. Around the time of the outbreak of World War II, the Liljevalchs Konsthall in Stockholm mounted a retrospective of his work. He died in New York in 1943.','Te Voir Marcher est un Événement Énorme',1778,'1778','Signed in white crayon and numbered 22/130, published by ABCD Editions.

Trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, Edgar Degas was a pupil of Jean-Auguste-DominiqueIngres. He had a thorough academic education as an artist, reinforced by the copies of Old Master works that he made during a period of study in Italy (1856-9) and in the Louvre. His first independent works were history paintings, but Degas also painted many portraits. Early in the 1860s, he began to paint modern life genre scenes – initially of racecourses, and then, later in the decade, of theatre and ballet scenes. In many of these, he made a novel and ambitious combination of portraiture with genre painting, by showing recognisable figures in their habitual surroundings of work or leisure, for instance the members of the orchestra in L\'Orchestre de l\'Opéra (circa 1870; Paris, Musée d\'Orsay).\n\nDuring the 1870s he developed this idea further, notably in Portraits dans un Bureau (Nouvelle-Orléans) (1873; Pau, Musée des Beaux-Arts), an elaborate interior of a cotton office, painted during a visit to his uncle’s family in New Orleans. At the same time, he became increasingly preoccupied with ballet subjects. Normally the dancers are shown rehearsing or at rest, sometimes under the instruction of a recognisable male ballet maste; but many pictures focus on the dancers alone, anonymous members of the corps de ballet, harmoniously grouped as they practise or rest backstage.','Sans titre (Untitled)',1779,'1779','Marked Ron Arad for MAGIS, Made in Italy','19th/20th Century',5600,'Bronze','Painted in London, UK','60069','Edition 22/130',45,2600,-1,81,70,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the US','','Mat staining, pale stains in margins, minor defects alongside edges of sheet.',NULL,44,1,67,1,1),(68,'In his scenes of modern life, Degas developed distinctive compositional techniques, viewing the subjects from unexpected angles and framing his compositions in unconventional ways, often cutting off figures and other forms at the margins of the picture, an effect clearly influenced by his interest in photography. Although this self-conscious artifice distinguishes his art from that of the Impressionist landscape painters and their concern with painting out of doors, Degas regularly exhibited in the Impressionist group exhibitions between 1874 and 1886. Throughout his career, Degas experimented with a great variety of techniques, and, from around 1880 onwards, increasingly explored the possibilities of pastel. From the late 1870s onwards he made a sequence of wax sculptures, of dancers, bathing women and horses. Sculpture was almost a private medium for Degas and the figures were radical when cast in bronze for their lack of monumentality and their often tender, unidealised forms.\n\nFailing eyesight in his last years restricted Degas’s production and may have contributed to the broadening of his technique, but this had little impact on the overall development of his career in its gradual shift from the explicit modernity of his scenes of the 1870s to the richer and more simplified colour effects of his later work.','Head of Nothing',1780,'1780','Signed at right, dated behind with stamp, ‘Washington Studio, NY 1991’','19th/20th Century',2300,'Bronze','Painted in Florence, Italy','60064','Edition 117/150',-1,2800,-1,70,80,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave France','','',NULL,44,1,68,1,1),(69,'Russian painter, printmaker, interior decorator, textile and fashion designer. Born in the Ukraine, Sonia Delaunay was active in France and the wife of Robert Delaunay. Perhaps more than any other modern artist, Delaunay forged a link between the fine and the applied arts. She was the youngest of three children and in 1890 was adopted at the age of five by her maternal uncle, Henri Terk, a lawyer in St Petersburg. She had early contacts with Germany, visiting the artist Max Liebermann in Berlin in 1899 and studying drawing with Ludwig Schmidt-Reutter (1863-1909) in Karlsruhe from 1903 to 1905. In 1905 she moved to Paris to study at the Académie de la Palette. There she met Amédée Ozenfant, André Dunoyer de Segonzac and Jean-Louis Boussingault. She learnt printmaking from Rudolf Grossmann (1882-1941). Her early painting was figurative, with references to Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin and the Fauves. She exhibited at the Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon at the Galerie Der Sturm, Berlin in 1913 and again at the Galerie Der Sturm in 1920 and 1921.\n\nDelaunay executed her first abstract work in 1911: a patchwork quilt for the cradle of her newborn son, Charles. Its contrasting intense colours suggested new ideas about space and movement to the Delaunays and together they pursued the study of colour, influenced by the theories of Michael Eugéne Chevreul. They adopted the stylistic label ‘simultaneity’ in order to distinguish their work, which sought to convey the dynamism of modern life by the juxtaposition of colour. Sonia realised that such juxtapositions need not be limited to a canvas but could extend to any other surface.','Expansion',1781,'1781','Signed lower left','20th Century',4100,'colour lithograph','Painted in Venice, Italy','60065','Edition of 6',-1,5400,-1,43,36,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the Germany','','',NULL,45,1,69,1,1),(70,'In 1912 Delaunay produced her first fabrics in her non-figurative series Contrastes Simultanés (1912; Paris, Pompidou) and her first simultaneous collages.

Jean Dubuffet was one of France’s pre-eminent mid-20th-century artists, coining the term Art Brut for the style of raw, outsider production he favoured. As the son of a prosperous wine merchant in Le Havre, Dubuffet initially went into his father’s business after becoming disillusioned with his studies in Paris and growing sceptical of the artist’s privileged status. Drafted into the army in 1939, Dubuffet was briefly imprisoned for failing to salute an officer. After demobilisation, he found his wine trade flourishing but elected to lease it out and devote himself to art full-time, at the age of 41.\n\nDubuffet did not waste time during the next four decades: ‘For the first time I allowed myself carte blanche to paint in perfect liberty, and at top speed, without troubling to cast a critical gaze upon my work, and experimenting in all directions.’ He soon began to exhibit in Paris and attracted the attention of such intellectuals as the poets Paul Eluard and Henri Michaux and the critic Jean Paulhan (1884-1968). In 1945, soon after the Armistice, he and Paulhan journeyed to Switzerland to seek out examples of Art Brut. In 1947 Dubuffet sold his business and over the next few years went on three long visits to the Sahara, immersing himself in what he saw as the vital culture of a non-Western, pre-literate society.\n\nThe lively succession of provocative exhibitions in Paris from the mid-1940s had established Dubuffet as an important creative force in post-war art. His work, hitherto resolutely figurative, came close to abstraction in the 1950s and in 1961, encouraged by the Danish painter Asger Jorn, Dubuffet experimented with musical instruments and non-musical sounds, producing several eccentric records from his own tapes.\n\nThe 1970s was a time of ambitious sculptural and environmental projects, including important public commissions such as the Group of Four Trees (1970-2), in Chase Manhattan Plaza, New York. Following the establishment of the Dubuffet Fondation at Périgny-sur-Yerres in 1974 and the inauguration of the Collection de l’Art Brut at Lausanne in 1976, Dubuffet continued working until his death in 1985.','Expansion',1797,'1797','Signed at right, dated behind with stamp, ‘Washington Studio, NY 1991’','20th Century',6600,'oil on masonite','Painted in London, UK','60081','Edition 35/300',-1,8100,-1,92,112,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the Italy','','',NULL,49,1,85,1,1),(86,'Swedish artist and art theorist.

In 1907 Engström, along with fellow students, formed a radical group known first as the Young Ones (De Unga), then as the Men of the Year 1909 (1909 Års Män), which was particularly influenced by contemporary French art. Active between 1907-11, the group included such artists as Isaac Grünewald and Gösta Sandels.

Their Stockholm exhibitions (1909-11) of richly coloured, modernistic work instigated great debate as they represented the first artists to champion Swedish Expressionism.\n\nEngström took much inspiration from Sweden’s northern mountains around Abisko where he built himself a house, but also from his travels beyond: the landscapes of Denmark and Lapland (e.g. Scene from Lapland, 1916; Moderna Museet Stockholm), and the paintings of the Italian Primitives held particular sway.

Concrete art, coined by Dutch artist and theorist Theo van Doesburg, stated that the work of art should be constructed purely of plastic elements – that is to say plans and colours, natural forms, lyricism and sentiment were strictly forbidden. With his streamlined focus on the diagonal theme, Falk is currently the leading proponent other thanOlleBaertling of the aesthetics of ‘open form’.

From 1910 he participated in the exhibitions of the Berlin Secession and from 1913 had contacts with Der Sturm Galerie in Berlin. His expressive early works included both sculptures and flat, geometric paintings. Having spent World War I in Cologne, from 1918-24 he lived in Berlin, where he was one of the founder members of the Novembergruppe in 1918, and contributed to the radical newspaper Die Aktion: ZeitschriftfürFreiheitlichePolitik und Literatur. In 1931 he was one of the first members of the group Abstraction-Création in Paris, where he then opened his own private academy.\n\nFrom the early 1920s,Freundlich developed a Constructivist style characterised by interlocking cellular forms, which was more elastic, rhythmic and colourful than his previous painting. Such compositions as My Sky is Red (1933; Paris, Pompidou) are based on an orthogonal framework, in which the right angles are twisted irregularly. The paintings contain elaborate systems of colour modulations which create complementary harmonies and degrees of spatial illusionism. The application of impastoed paint also creates a three-dimensional effect. Freundlich’s paintings often expressed his political views: his belief in ‘cosmic Communism’, for example, is associated with the colours in My Sky is Red. Freundlich’s work with stained glass from the early 1920s is closely linked with his abstract paintings and had the greatest influence on the development of his style. Freundlich achieved some success as one of the abstract painters who contributed to the Parisian Salon des RéalitésNouvelles (founded 1939).

Born NaumNeemia Pevsner, Gabo adopted a new surname to distinguish himself from his brother, the artist Antoine Pevsner. Gabo’s first constructed works were figurative but following his return to Russia in 1917 he started to make non-figurative reliefs and towers from transparent plastic and glass. In 1920 Gabo and his brother published the highly influential Realistic Manifesto. Rejecting Cubism and Futurism, Gabo called for an art for a new epoch, a public art recognising space and time as its basic elements and espousing construction and kineticism. In 1930 he had an important solo show at the Kestner-Gesellschaft in Hannover, and a year later became a member of the group Abstraction-Création in Paris. By 1933 Gabo had moved to Paris, but by 1936 had settled in London. There he made friends with Herbert Read, Leslie Martin and Ben Nicholson, with whom in 1937 he edited Circle: International Survey of Constructive Art. \n\nDissonanz is one of Gabo’s earliest oils, painted in Carbis Bay, Cornwall. Gabo moved to the county in 1939, two days after the outbreak of World War II. Materials were scarce so he was unable to continue working on constructivist sculptures; however, supplies for drawing and painting were more readily available. Writing to the young artist Peter Lanyon in 1942 he stated, ‘I have been interrupted by wars five times in my life and I know that they do end. What you cannot do with your hands, try to do in your imagination – make drawings and it will not be lost for you.’ \n\nGabo had always used drawings to investigate folding surfaces and spatial curvature, however his oil paintings were not simply studies or experiments for final constructions but finished works in themselves. They are clearly conceived from a sculptor’s mind: ‘I often turn to painting when the image of my experience becomes so involved in structure, in form and in colour that there is no possible way for me to execute in a three dimensional material,’ Gabo explained. Painting also provided him with an opportunity to use colour and texture as additional constructive elements. He enjoyed the nature of paint, often mixing his own colours. The vivid palette of Dissonanzreveals his Russian heritage. Its varied array of deep blues reverberate against the yellow core, creating an exciting friction on the surface of the painting. The central yellow area is made up of many different shades which allowed Gabo to explore the composition in a more three-dimensional way, as one might explore facets of a sculpture. \n\nDissonanzhas toured with two retrospective exhibitions of Naum Gabo’s work: the first starting in Amsterdam in 1965 and touring to Mannheim, Duisburg, Zürich, Stockholm and London; the second, in 1968, at the Albright-Knox Gallery, Buffalo.','Untitled',1808,'1808','Signed in pencil lower right','20th Century',5100,'oil on canvas laid on board','Painted in Venice, Italy','60092','Edition 21/129',-1,5100,-1,81,70,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the UK','','',NULL,57,1,96,1,1),(97,'Gabo’s Russian upbringing undoubtedly influenced his work; his sculptures and paintings reflect the coming together of 20th-century science, philosophy, revolution and utopian ideas that defined the nation. During his time in Russia he worked alongside Kandinsky, Malevich and Tatlin at the forefront of the Russian avant-garde, inheriting many formal aspects of their art.\n\nAs well as taking inspiration from his Russian roots, Gabo was also influenced by artists living around him during his time in Cornwall (1939-46). He became friends with members of the large colony of artists who lived in the area, including Peter Lanyon, Barbara Hepworth, Ben Nicholson, Patrick Heron and Adrian Stokes. Life in Cornwall stimulated Gabo’s interest in the natural world and he began collecting shells, stones, pieces of bone and driftwood, which was the practice of both Henry Moore and Hepworth. It was also in Cornwall that he started using nylon monofilament. \n\nIn 1946 Gabo moved to the USA, where he became a close friend of Lewis Mumford. Following a major exhibition of his work in New York in 1948, he began to receive commissions for public projects. Gabo’s style does not fit simply into the machine aesthetic. As he wrote in 1957: ‘Not the machine – the creative spirit of man is my inspiration.’ \n\nAn artist of diverse interests, Gabo was fascinated and influenced by scientific and mathematical images, whether visually or verbally described, and particularly by the enigmas of science. While he valued supremely the autonomy of the artist, he also sought to integrate, not only sculpture, architecture and design, but also art and science into everything he created. Thus he felt that his ‘constructive idea’ could serve as a philosophy not only for art but also for life in general.','Inspiration',1809,'1809','Signed in white crayon and numbered 22/130, published by ABCD Editions.

Francesco Guardi was born in Venice to a family from Trentino. He was famous for his vedute, or views, of Venice which show the strong influence of Canaletto and Luca Carlevarijs. In contrast, however, with Canaletto’s hard architectural line, Guardi’s style of painting was soft and sfumato, a smoky technique of scumbled brushstrokes which made his work especially popular with the later French Impressionist painters. \n\nThe Gateway of the Dolo was certainly a much beloved subject of Francesco Guardi. The prototype he followed for his most imposing views of the scene is that painted by Canaletto, now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, which also inspired Bernardo Bellotto and Giovanni Battista Cimaroli.\n\nGuardi also painted a number of other versions of the Porta del Dolo that on first sight look more like capricci than accurate views.

Though a Scot by birth and artistic training, Gunn was to develop a stylevery much of his own, imbued with influences from French Impressionism and Modern British painting as well asfrom his Scottish heritage. \n\nFollowing his studies at Edinburgh, Gunn travelled to Paris, enrolling at the Académie Julian under Jean-Paul Laurens. He remained in Paris until 1914 when the threat of an unsettled continent forced him back to the UK. It was, however, during his time in France that Gunn developed a radical approach to compositional arrangements. His often-stark palette of grey tones was used to heighten the dramatic placement of forms and the current work is one of a series of small plein-air views in which Gunn captured the Parisian light throughthis elegant, sparing, execution.\n\nOn his return to England, Gunn rapidly established himself as a leading painter of portraits in addition to landscapes and conversation pieces. Gunn exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1923, at the Royal Scottish Academy and in Paris, where in 1931 he was awarded a silver medal at the Société Artistes Français and a gold medal at the Paris Salon of 1939. \n\nThroughout the 1930s and 1940s Gunn’s reputation as a portrait painter increased.

Determined to expand his knowledge of engraving, he left Japan for Paris, arriving in 1961. Studying under Stanley William Hayter in the Atelier 17, Hasegawa soon started to create abstract imagery, yet continued to use traditional Japanese materials. Initially his work was starkly linear, using only monochromatic tones of black into greys, but he swiftly moved beyond this, combining Eastern and Western influences to create his own unique style. Over a translucent background in the popular Parisian style of the time, tachisme (haphazard dabs and splotches used in lyrical abstraction), he engraved white decorative patterns in the Japanese tradition of popular imagery. \nThroughout the 1960s he exhibited in numerous group and solo shows in Europe (particularly Paris, Stockholm and Krakow) and North America (mainly Ottawa, Canada). In 1965 he won the Ljubljana International Engraving Exhibition Prize, followed in 1968 by the First Prize for Engraving at the International Exhibition of Como. \nOver the last 30 years, Hasegawa has mastered the art of transparency. In his etchings, where the paper is covered with only a thin layer of ink, details of the marks show through to create a depth rarely seen before.

Although Sweden remained neutral during World War II, he carried out his military service with a platoon of Laplanders near the Norwegian border. \nFollowing the war, Hedberg spent short periods at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Art in Copenhagen and the AcadémieColarossi in Paris, before arriving in Capri in 1947.

This was close to where Picasso was working with local potters. Five years later Hedberg held a one-man show at La Boutique d’Art in Nice establishing himself as a leading artist in the area. Picasso, Léger and Cocteau all visited his studio and Chagall stayed as a student (somewhat unsuccessfully) for three months.

As well as creating free-standing sculptures Hedberg also produced large and varied reliefs, for buildings including the parish church in Köpmanholmen (1959) and the Faculty of Science at Marseille University (1960-6).

Jean Hélion was a painter whose abstract work of the 1930s established him as a leading Modernist. His mid-career rejection of abstraction was followed by nearly five decades as a figurative painter. He was also the author of several books and an extensive body of critical writing.\n\nIn 1929 Hélion produced his first abstract painting and, together with Theo van Doesburg, Otto Carlsund and the Armenian painter Leon Tutundjian, created the Art Concret group. He supervised the first, and only, issue of the journal Art Concret, in which he called for ‘pure painting, controlled by logic’, which describes the kind of orthogonally structured abstraction, related to Piet Mondrian, that he was painting at this time. This rather fundamentalist group later expanded into the Abstraction-Création movement, which included Jean Arp, Albert Gleizes, AugusteHerbin and Robert Delaunay. In the same period he met the British artists Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and John Piper. In America he became important for the generation of Arshile Gorky, Willem de Kooning and especially the American Abstract Artists group, through both his painting and his intellectually rigorous attitudes towards art.\n\nIn 1940 Hélion left America for war service in France. He was captured by the Germans but escaped from a prisoner of war camp and found his way back to the USA in 1942. He moved from Virginia to New York in 1944, and the city’s streets provided a range of figurative motifs, such as shop window mannequins and men smoking.\n\nIn 1946 Hélion returned to Paris, remaining in France for the rest of his career. His disavowal of radical abstraction proved as controversial in Paris as it had in New York, and he suffered considerable adverse criticism on this account. Between 1947 and 1952 he evolved a series of archetypal figures, ‘the newspaper reader’, ‘the nude model’, ‘the poet/outsider as passive witness’, which seem to reflect the mood of Existentialism then prevailing in Paris, and Hélion’s work at this time can be compared with that of BalthusKlossowskiand Alberto Giacometti.

The incomprehension that greeted these reliefs and related furniture designs, even from those critics most favourably disposed towards Cubism, was such that until 1926 or 1927 he followed Rosenberg’s advice to return to a representational style.

Hepworth’s carvings up to the mid-1930s are chunky, resolutely solid and basically figurative, displaying much less interest in the ‘savage’ side of non-Western carving than those of Moore. Her development of piercing and of a progressive opening of form to light and space ran parallel to a process of refinement in her work through the 1940s, epitomised in Pelagos (1946; London, Tate). During this period she rid her work of references to the human body, venturing as early as 1936 from biomorphic to crystalline forms while never abandoning her liking for curves.\n\nHepworth met and married Ben Nicholson in 1931-32 after her divorce from her first husband Hugh Skeaping.

From 1935 she exhibited with the 7 & 5 Society, and in 1936 she took part in a seminal exhibition, Abstract & Concrete. Together with a group of eminent European exiles who arrived in London in the mid-1930s, including Piet Mondrian, Naum Gabo and László Moholy-Nagy, she and other English artists based in Hampstead became the centre of an informal but intellectually cohesive group committed to avant-garde ideas.\n\nJust before the outbreak of World War II, Hepworth and Nicholson went to stay with the critic Adrian Stokes in Carbis Bay, near St Ives, Cornwall, where they were joined by Gabo. Hepworth made St Ives her permanent home. In compliance with the wishes expressed before her death, her former studio and home became the Barbara Hepworth Museum and was opened in 1980 as an outpost of the Tate.','Sans titre (Untitled)',1833,'1833','Signed lower left','20th Century',0,'marble on originial artist\'s wooden base','Painted in London, UK','1004','Edition 28/70',-1,4300,-1,189,98,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the UK','','Mat staining, pale stains in margins, minor defects alongside edges of sheet.',NULL,71,1,121,1,1),(122,'Swedish painter and draughtsman. Carl Fredrik Hill grew up in the university city of Lund, where his father was a mathematics professor. Despite severe opposition from his father, he studied landscape painting at the Konstakademi in Stockholm (1871-72) under Johan Edvard Bergh and Per Daniel Holm (1835-1903). He also frequently copied Dutch Old Masters, particularly Jacob van Ruisdael. After seeing the work that Alfred Wahlberg had sent home from Paris, Hill began to abandon his initial approach to form and colour, resulting in his trip to Paris in November 1873. His most important experience there was his encounter with the painting of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot: ‘Corot has discovered a new world, because he has discovered a new way of looking at the old,’ he wrote in a letter. Other contemporary French painters Hill admired were Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, Charles-François Daubigny, Jean-François Millet and Théodore Rousseau. From GustaveCourbet he learnt how to use colour to suggest the surface texture of stone quarries and gravel hills. In Barbizon in 1874 and 1875 Hill met the Hungarian painters LászlóPaál and Mihály von Muncácsy. His paintings of this time, for example Autumn Landscape, Evening: Fontainebleau (1875; Malmö, Art Museum), are characterised by their dark ‘luminarism’ and their debt to Corot’s later works.\n\nUnder the influence of Impressionism, the dark bitumen colours disappeared from Hill’s painting in 1876. Hill called this approach ‘the most realistic’ and considered that he had discovered his true painting style. However, he never adopted typical Impressionism style, even though he used a broad, painterly technique and often employed a palette knife. His development was rapid and he worked at a feverish pitch. In 1875 he was represented at the Paris Salon, but he was forced to exhibit his more radical paintings of 1876 in the Salon des Refusés that year. He was also represented at the Exposition Universelle in 1878. He had few contacts with other Swedes in Paris because of his reclusive character. He preferred to live and work near the countryside, moving in 1876, after his time in Barbizon, to the towns of Champagne-sur-Oise, Montigny-sur-Loing and Luc-sur-Mer, and in 1877 to Bois-le-Roi on the Seine.','Head of Nothing',1834,'1834','Signed ‘GAN’ and dated ‘28.

Sigrid Hjertén studied at the Konstindustriellaskola in Stockholm from 1905-08. She specialised in weaving and worked with the weaver Selma Giöbel. Having decided to become a painter, Hjertén studied at Henri Matisse’s academy in Paris from 1909 to 1911. There she met the Swedish painter Isaac Grünewald, who she married in 1911. The same year Hjertén wrote an article about Paul Cézanne’s work in SvenskaDagbladet. This was probably the first article about Cézanne’s work to be published in Sweden. Along with Grünewald, and other painters who had studied at Matisse’s academy, she introduced French Modernism to the country. In 1915 Hjertén and Grünewald exhibited at Herwarth Walden’s Der Sturm Galerie, Berlin. Besides Matisse, both Futurism and German Expressionism influenced Hjertén’s work.\n\nHjertén’s paintings from 1914-19 are of particular importance. In Interior of a Studio and The Red Blind (both 1916; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet) she expressed her conscious and unconscious response to life as a woman, a painter and a mother. The hostility and harsh criticism that Hjertén and Grünewald met when they exhibited Modernist work during the 1910s, however, made Hjertén retire from the official art scene until a retrospective exhibition in 1936. Between 1920 and 1930 Hjertén and Grünewald lived in Paris. During the 1930s Hjertén experimented with colour and made strong colouristic compositions inspired, for example, by her observations of the harbour in Stockholm and by her travels to the south of Europe. She suffered from severe depression, and in 1937 entered a psychiatric hospital, where she died some years later.','Expansion',1835,'1835','Signed ‘GAN’ and dated ‘28.

He travelled to Paris in 1921 where he studied under Emile-Antoine Bourdelle until 1924. In Paris he was influenced by Cubism and produced such sculptures as the current work,Cubist Girl (also in Stockholm, ModernaMuseet), while the influence of vernacular art is evident in the expressive Girl’s Head (wood, 1922). He participated in various group exhibitions in Paris, Stockholm and elsewhere in the late 1920s. During this time his painting began to show the influence of the Swedish folk art tradition, as in the Näively executed At the Kitchen Table (1923; Göteborg, Art Museum). This tradition supplanted the influence of Cubism in his sculpture, leading to more realistic works such as Girl with Violin (bronze, 1929; Stockholm, Modern Museum).\n\nHe worked in Copenhagen in 1938 and 1939 producing reliefs for Skogskyrkogårdens Crematorium in Stockholm. The solid, bulky figures of Rodin and his Muse(bronze, 1936; Stockholm, ModernaMuseet) were typical of the works of this period. In 1944 he produced sculpture and relief work for the chapel at Borås Crematorium.

Jean-Auguste Dominique Ingres was trained first by his father, a sculptor in Montauban, then at the Toulouse Academy, before entering the Paris studio of Jacques-Louis David in 1797. Ingres was a curious and contradictory figure, yet one of the greatest French painters of the 19thcentury. Despite his lifelong devotion to the antique and to the example of RaffaelloSanzio da Urbino(Raphael), he was, as much as his Romantic rival EugèneDelacroix, in rebellion against the academic norms imposed by the school of David, though he continued to admire the personal achievement of his master. He was an establishment painter with a highly idiosyncratic and emotionally charged style. He exhibited at the 1824 Paris Salon; the RaphaelesqueVow of Louis XIII was the first of Ingres’s paintings to win near universal acclaim.\n\nIn January 1825 he was awarded the Légiond’Honneur, but was so outraged when critics disparaged hisMartyrdom of Saint Symphorien, shown in the Salon of 1834, that he left France for Rome, vowing never to work for the government again. Ingres returned to Paris in June 1841, when King Louis-Philippe received him personally for a tour around Versailles, an honour he felt his status befitted.

After graduating in art history and sculpture, his initial artistic career began in theatre design which he continued to study at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière and Académie Julian in Paris. During World War II, Jouve was taken prisoner at Lorraine in 1940 then interned in a German camp before escaping to Nyons. Settling in Dieulefit, Drône, a village known for its potters, Jouve created many decorative pieces, the majority of which had a sacred or ritualistic focus.

Landy gathered all his possessions, ranging from postage stamps to his car, including all his clothes and works of art by himself and others, and then destroyed them all in public. The process of destruction was done on something resembling an assembly line in a mass production factory, with workers shredding each of the painstakingly catalogued 7,227 items.\n\nLandy’sArt Bin installation for the South London Gallery in 2010 was described by the artist as ‘a monument to creative failure’.

During that time he painted Soldiers Playing at Cards (Otterlo, Kröller-Müller), which he regarded as ‘the first picture in which I deliberately took my subject from our own epoch’. He returned from this ordeal with a profound appreciation of the human qualities of the common man to which, as he observed, he himself belonged, and with the conviction, no doubt inspired by the Futurists, that the breech of a canon was a formally beautiful object more relevant than all the artistic subject matter favoured in the past. Like so many others of his generation, Léger imagined that the Russian revolution held the promise of a renewal of mankind and the brief triumph of the Popular Front in France suggested that this was really the age of the common man.

This technique emphasised the clichés of popular imagery while also endowing them with iconic status. Having elevated the comic book to fine art, Lichtenstein used the same technique to reduce high art to the level of a comic by adapting details from paintings by Pablo Picasso and other masters and rendering both techniques and styles in elegant and humorous pastiche.','Flat Standing Figure',1860,'1860','Signed in white crayon and numbered 22/130, published by ABCD Editions.

Bruno Liljefors studied at the Konstakademi in Stockholm (1879-82). During a trip abroad in 1882-3 he attended lectures in Düsseldorf by the German animal painter Carl Friedrich Deikerand made animal studies at the city zoo, one of the largest in Europe. He concluded his travels by visiting France in 1883-4 and again in 1886. For a while he was a member of the Scandinavian artists’ colony in Grez-sur-Loingand he exhibited at the Salon de Paris in 1884. The influence of both French plein-air painting and Japanese woodcuts is apparent in his first important work, Hawk and Black Game (1884; Stockholm Nationalmuseum), a ‘close-up’ of nature that fills the whole picture surface. \n\nAll his life Liljefors was a hunter, and he often painted predator/prey action, the hunts engaged between fox and hare, sea eagle and eider, and goshawk and black grouse serving as prime examples. However, he never exaggerated the ferocity of the predator or the pathos of the prey, and his pictures are devoid of sentimentality. Liljefors was fascinated by the patterns to be found in nature, and he often made art out of the camouflage patterns of animals and birds. He particularly loved painting capercaillies against woodland, and his most successful painting of this subject is the large-scale CapercaillieLek (1888), in which he captures the atmosphere of the forest at dawn. \n\nDuring the last years of the 19th century a brooding element entered his work, perhaps the result of turmoil in his private life, as he left his wife, Anna, and took up with her younger sister, Signe, and was often short of money. He amassed a collection of animals to act as his living models. Ernst Malmberg recalled: ‘The animals seemed to have an instinctive trust and actual attraction to him...There in his animal enclosure, we saw his inevitable power over its many residents – foxes, badgers, hares, squirrels, weasels, an eagle, eagle owl, hawk, capercaillie and black game.’\n\nThe greatness of Liljefors lay in his ability to show animals in their environment. Sometimes he achieved this through hunting and observation of the living animal, and sometimes he used dead animals: for example his Hawk and Black Game, painted in the winter of 1883-4, was based on dead specimens, but he also used his memory of the flocks of black grouse in the meadows around a cottage he once lived in at Ehrentuna, near Uppsala. Liljefors was a pioneer at a time when wildlife art was still emerging from its association with scientific depiction and taxidermy. He set a standard of identification with the landscape which substantially influenced the subsequent development of wildlife art in the 20thcentury.','Verticale Brune 1 (Vertical Brown 1)',1861,'1861','Signed in white crayon and numbered 22/130, published by ABCD Editions.

The son of a frame maker, John Linnell came to the notice of connoisseurs and artists at an early age: he visited Benjamin West in 1804 while Joseph Farington mentioned Sir George Beaumont’s interest in Linnell’s sketches. In 1805 he entered the Royal Academy Schools and became a pupil of JohnVarley. He participated in the naturalist movement of the early 19th century, making oil sketches from nature along the Thames (e.g. Study of Buildings – Study from Nature, 1806; London, Tate), in the company of William Henry Hunt and William Mulready. His friendship with Cornelius Varley led in 1811-2 to his entry into the Baptist church and a more intense interest in humble landscapes, often including labourers at work (e.g. Kensington Gravel Pits, 1812; London, Tate). In the following decade he made several sketching tours, including a trip to north Wales with George Robert Lewis in 1813, and produced remarkably fresh watercolour sketches. He exhibited his oils at the Society of Painters in Oil and Water-Colours from 1813 until 1820. With his marriage in 1817 and the onset of family responsibilities, he turned his attention to portraiture. He acquired royal and aristocratic patronage and executed a miniature of Princess Sophia Matilda(1821; British Royal College, London), the daughter of William Henry, Duke of Gloucester. Large-scale portraits in oil, such as Lady Torrens and her Family (1820; New York, Mrs. Richard Selle private collection) show the influence of leading portrait painter Thomas Lawrence.\n\nLinnell played an important part in the last years of William Blake’s life from 1818, commissioning the engravings for the Book of Jobin 1823 and the watercolours for Dante’s Divine Comedy in 1824, and giving Blake a regular income in his old age. Linnell introduced Samuel Palmer to Blake in 1824, having already encouraged Palmer, since meeting him in 1822, to study early Renaissance art and to make intensive studies from nature. Linnell and Palmer became close friends, and Linnell made several visits to Palmer’s house in Shoreham, Kent. He has often been blamed for Palmer’s move away from visionary landscape, but in the 1820s he was a fruitful influence on Palmer, and the two men shared many of the same ideals, including a belief that landscape painting could be a form of religious art. From the time of Palmer’s marriage to Linnell’s daughter Hannah in 1837 the relationship deteriorated, owing mainly to political and religious differences (Linnell was a radical Nonconformist, Palmer a High Church Tory) and as Linnell became more extreme in his views and eccentric in his habits.','Modul Skulptur i Färg B19 (Module Sculpture in Colour B19)',1862,'1862','Signed in white crayon and numbered 21/130, published by ABCD Editions.

At the same time he experimented with a type of Cubism, as in the angular, stylised Mountain Landscape, which was influenced by the work of André Lhote. In 1917 he painted a mural for the TekniskaHögskola in Stockholm and the same year was a founder member of a Swedish painters’ group that included Victor Axelson, Alf Munthe, FritiofScüldt and Axel Nilsson, which was active until 1923.

Henri Matisse is widely regarded as one of the two greatest artists of the 20th century, alongside his great contemporary and rival, Pablo Picasso. Matisse, noble and serious by nature, demonstrated an almost ruthless dedication to work and progressive development. Born at Le Cateau-Cambrésis in northern France, he was originally a student of law in Paris but enrolled at the Académie Julian in 1891 (under the tutelage ofWilliam-Adolphe Bouguereau) and the École des Beaux-Arts (under Gustave Moreau) in 1892, staying there until 1896. Fellow students included Henri Manguin, Albert Marquet and Georges Rouault. He was elected associate of the Société Nationale in 1896 after selling a painting to the nation from among the four he exhibited at the Salon du Champ de Mars, Paris. Influenced in tone and colour by Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Matisse now experienced the Impressionists’ work and visited London, on Camille Pissarro’s advice, to look at Joseph Mallord William Turner; this lead him to adopt a brighter palette and make colour experiments which freed colour from association or description. Paul Signac bought his Luxe, Calme et Volupté (Paris, Musée d’Orsay) from the 1905 Salon des Indépendants. At the Salon d’Automne of that year, he and his friends Marquet, Manguin, André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck made a sensational impact and were thereafter called Fauves. Michael, Leo, and Gertrude Stein began to collect his work, Leo buying Le Bonheur de Vivre (Merion, Philadelphia, Barnes Foundation) from the 1906 Indépendants.*\n\nThe quest for integrity of form when applying colour at its most intense led to the abandonment of conventional spatial devices, yet, while achieving great expressive power, Matisse turned away from Expressionism, seeking ‘balance, purity and moderation’. Another stated aim, to bring comfort and express joy, was realised in his deployment of pure colour and increasingly abstract compositions, forming a powerful mode of decorative painting. In sculpture, printmaking, illustration and drawing, he invented and demonstrated new, influential forms. \n\n* The American Stein family became very important art collectors purportedly starting their collection in 1904 with 8,000 francs. By early 1906, Leo and Gertrude Stein’s house at 27 rue de Fleurus, Parishad many paintings by Pierre Bonnard, Pablo Picasso, Paul Cézanne, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Honoré Daumier, Henri Matisse and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. In 1933, Gertrude Stein published the memoirs of her Paris years titled The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, which became a literary bestseller.','Sans titre (Untitled)',1871,'1871','Signed ‘GAN’ and dated ‘28.

Joan Miró was born and studied in Barcelona, where he met Pablo Picasso. Miró was 18 before he decided to devote himself to painting, having been initially struck by the primitive frescoes on the walls of local Romanesque churches and then, at art school, by the experiments of the European avant-garde. His early works, from around 1914, were painted in strong, hot colours and show some Cubist influence. In 1920 he moved to Paris and in 1925 took part in the First Surrealist Exhibition in the Galerie Pierre. However, while recognised as a distinguished member of the Surrealist group and sharing their interest in the unconscious, Miró retained his independence and his style remained distinctive. André Breton went as far as describing Miró as ‘probably the most Surrealist of us’, although his paintings were deemed ‘childlike’ and ‘innocent’.Miró ignored the hostility between Surrealism and general abstraction, instead exploiting the tensions between them in delicate, tautly poised compositions which expressed the energies of life through rhythmically organised amoeboid forms, withcosmic, botanical, geometric or abstract lines floating against celestial blue, sandy yellow or earth brown backgrounds.','Colour Motion',1424,'1424','Signed in pencil lower right','20th Century',5600,'Lithograph','Painted in Toulouse, France','60054','Edition 92/150',-1,2800,-1,65,66,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the Germany','','',NULL,96,1,164,1,1),(165,'In the 1920s, Miró’s paintings moved closer to pure drawing, which is perhaps why he would so frequently turn to lithography and other methods of printmaking throughout his career. ‘I have noticed that the ones that have been painted touch the spirit less directly than the ones that are simply drawn (or that use a minimum of colour),’ he wrote in 1924, adding, ‘There is no doubt that my canvases that are simply drawn, with a few dots of colour, a rainbow, are more profoundly moving.’\n\nBut he was still not satisfied. In 1928 he declared, ‘I want to murder painting.’ And for the next two years he literally turned against paint, adding sandpaper, tar paper, feathers, wire, string, nails and other ordinary objects to his canvases as collages. And even when he returned to painting in 1930, he often painted black and red shapes on sandpaper, with disturbing effect. ‘I personally don\'t know where we are heading,’ Miró told a Spanish journalist in 1931. ‘The only thing that’s clear to me is that I intend to destroy, destroy everything that exists in painting. I have utter contempt for painting. The only thing that interests me is the spirit itself, and I only use the customary artists’ tools – brushes, canvas and paint – in order to get the best effects.

One of most important British artists of the 20th century, Moore was one of eight children by a Yorkshire coal-mining engineer and was born in Castleford. By the time he went to study at Leeds School of Art in 1919, he had already seen active service in World War I – initially he was the youngest man in his regiment – and had spent three months in a military hospital after having been gassed. In 1921 he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art, London, where, in addition to his studies, he spent much of his time at the British Museum. An enthusiastic Modernist, Moore kept in touch with European developments and admired the work of the British sculptors Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Eric Gill. \n\nFrom 1925 until 1931 he taught at the Royal College of Art. In 1928 he received his first commission, a relief for the London Underground Headquarters, which proved controversial because of its primitivism. His work of this period, like the Reclining Figure (1929; Leeds, Art Gallery) shows the influence of Epstein and primitive Mayan art. During the 1930s Moore was associated with the Hampstead artists, particularly Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth, whom he joined in the 7 & 5 Society in 1930 and Unit One in 1933, and moved to the Chelsea School of Art (1932-9) which he found more progressive than the Royal College. The abstract biomorphic carvings of this period are among his most innovative works and, in common with Hepworth, he also explored the potential of the pierced form, a stylistic device which was to bring him notoriety in the 1930s.','Modul Skulptur i Färg B19 (Module Sculpture in Colour B19)',1429,'1429','Marked Ron Arad for MAGIS, Made in Italy','20th Century',1200,'Bronze with mottled black patina and string','Painted Brive-la-Gaillarde, France','60059','Edition 22/130',24,600,-1,81,70,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the Germany','','Mat staining, pale stains in margins, minor defects alongside edges of sheet.',NULL,97,1,169,1,1),(170,'During World War II Moore made the works for which he is perhaps most admired, the so-called ‘shelter drawings’. In his capacity as one of the London Home Guard, Moore haunted the subterranean caves – underground stations, factory basements – that had become the refuge for so many homeless during the Blitz. Back in the studio, he personalised his reactions in ink and chalk and watercolour, producing some of the finest depictions of the material cruelties of war since Francisco Goya.In the 1940s he also established an international reputation that was confirmed by the award of the International Sculpture Prize at the Venice Biennale of 1948. During the 1950s monumental reclining female figures, of varying degrees of abstraction, dominated his work, culminating in the Reclining Figure carved for the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) building, Paris, in 1957. He also produced increasing numbers of modelled and cast figures and through the 1960s experimented with sculptures in several parts, creating tension between the individual elements. Determinedly humanist, even at his most abstract, Moore’s forms evolved to chart human awareness and anxieties in a changing world.

It was during this period that he also visited Paris to take advantage of the timedsketching classes at the Académie Colarossi, and to draw, in the Trocadero, a plaster cast of a Toltec-Maya sculptural form, the Chac Mool, previously seen in book illustrations.

In 1930, for economic reasons, the workshop merged with Morton Sundour’s main weaving factory in Carlisle, but retained its individual identity which continued through to when Morton was appointed Artistic Director in 1932.

While living in Carlisle, he began a life-long friendship with Ben and Winifred Nicholson in the early 1930s, becoming a substantial benefactor to them during the formative years of Abstract Constructivism. He started to paint in 1936, contributing to Circle: International Survey of Constructivist Art, edited by Ben Nicholson and Naum Gabo and exhibited at the Minto House Exhibition of Modern Art in May 1937. In it Nicholson wrote: ‘The designs I made for Edinburgh Weavers were entirely brought about by him [Alistair Morton],’ but he also personally wrote to Morton in 1940 about his paintings saying: ‘I expect the new oil abstracts are very good. It is the sustained tension in these more serious works that is really satisfying.’ Hepworth meanwhile wrote to Morton about his use of black: ‘I like the ones with black and primary colours side by side – very virile and exciting balance.’\n\nNicholson and Hepworth were without doubt great influences on Morton as an artist.

Nicholson lived in London from 1932-9, making several trips to Paris in 1932-3, visiting the studios of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Hans Arp, Constantin Brancusi and Piet Mondrian.

Often regarded as one of Sweden’s most prominent female artists, Vera Nilsson was born in Jönköping in 1888, studied at the Technical School in Stockholm (1906-9), before attending the School of Fine Art in Gothenburg under Carl Wilhelmson in 1910. During 1911-2 Nilsson lived in Paris, studying Cubism under Henri Le Fauconnier at the Académie de la Palette. \n\nHer debut exhibition of drawings and paintings, shared with Mollie Faustman, was held in 1917 in Copenhagen. By 1922 she was the only female artist included in Phalanx, a group of 17 Swedish artists made up of former pupils of Henri Matisse, which included Leander Engrström the Elder. \n\nAs can be seen in By på Öland, by 1930, Nilsson was combining bold brushstrokes with intense Expressionist colours for her landscapes, revealing perhaps an influence of the Göteborg Colourists, active in Sweden’s west coast in the 1920s. Öland was a particular inspiration for her landscape studies as Nilsson spent most of her summers there. Her output also co-existed happily with the primitive colourism emanating from the influential Färg och Form group of 1932, of which she was once more the only female member. \n\nAs well as landscapes, Nilsson painted many emotionally charged figurative works, revealing a fascination with the ordinary in life, whether it was a child blowing bubbles or intensely writing a letter. \n\nNilsson was a prime advocate for getting art permanently into the Stockholm Metro, resulting in her and 11 other artists being commissioned to produce artwork for the underground. This culminated in 1957 in Nilsson’s mosaic-tiled pillar on Central station’s upper platform entitled The beat that, after all, does not disappear. In 1954 Nilsson was elected to become a member of Stockholm’s Royal Academy of Fine Arts, the first female to be asked since 1889.\n\nHer works can be found in Stockholm’s National Museum and Museum of Modern Art, the Gothenburg Art Museum, Gripsholm Castle, as well as in Hamburg.','Expansion',1440,'1440','Signed','20th Century',9700,'Oil on canvas','Painted in San Felice Circeo, Italy','60065','Edition 97/150',-1,11400,-1,156,217,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the Italy','','',NULL,102,1,180,1,1),(181,'Swedish painter. In 1875 Karl Nordström went to Stockholm, where he studied at the Konstakademi and at the art school of Edvard Perséus. At the former he met the painters Richard Bergh and Nils Kreuger who became lifelong friends. He spent his formative years in France (1880-86) as a member of the Scandinavian artists’ colonies in Paris and Grez-sur-Loing. Having been attracted to Paris by the ideals of French Naturalism, he visited the Seventh Impressionist Exhibition (1882), which affected his painting of this period (e.g. The Old Bridge at Grèz, 1882; Stockholm, Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde). He spent most of his time in Grèz, dedicating himself to plein-air painting.\n\nNordström shared the radical views of his colleagues in exile and together they formed the protest movement Opponenterna. Led by the Swedish painter Ernst Josephson, they revolted against the conservatism of the Konstakademi in Stockholm and demanded its reorganisation. In 1885 Nordström and some of the opponents put on their first exhibition in Stockholm, Fran Seinens Strand (From the Banks of the Seine). In order to arrange their own exhibitions, the opponents formed the Konstnärsförbund (Artists’ Union) in 1886. For financial reasons Nordström had returned to Sweden that year. At first he tried to apply the painting techniques he had absorbed in France to northern landscapes, notably in Tjörn and then in Stockholm, where he settled with his family in 1888, but he soon developed a painting style based on the compositional principles of the Synthetists and Japanese masters, resulting in a simplification of forms and colours. He favoured views of Stockholm at dusk in blue or orange mists (e.g. View of Stockholm from Skansen, 1889). He spent the summer of 1889 on the Swedish island of Gotland. His study of the fine gradations of light resulted in a series of high quality drawings in charcoal, a medium that he was to favour throughout his career along with oils (e.g. Northern Town-wall, 1889; Visby, Säve-Salen). Such paintings as Storm Clouds (1893; Stockholm, Nationalmuseum) and Varberg Fort (1893; Stockholm, Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde) epitomise the wilderness in the barren landscapes of Tjörn and Varberg, their dark colours reflecting a melancholy mood typical of the National Romantic era. Stylistically they are based on the works of Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh, which Nordström had seen in Copenhagen.','The First Empire',1441,'1441','Signed in pencil lower right','20th Century',12500,'Oil on canvas,','Painted in Grez-sur-Loing, France.','60066','Edition 28/70',-1,9500,-1,189,98,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the UK','','',NULL,103,1,181,1,1),(182,'Swedish painter.

Olson and Lorentzon travelled to Paris in 1924 where they met Fernand Léger, helping in his studio together with Franciscka Clausen and Otto Carlsund. During this time Olson abandoned the style of his previous mentor and looked towards Léger for inspiration. He also adopted some of the aspects of Amédée Ozenfant’s art theories. \n\nIn 1929 Olson married Solvig Sven-Nilsson with whom he lived for periods in France and Denmark. Starting in the 1930s, he participated in exhibitions in, for example, Copenhagen, London, Paris and New York.

Olle Olsson-Hagalund was born the only child of Tuttan and Conny Olsson. He grew up in Hagalund, north of Stockholm, in a house with decorative woodwork framing the windows, eaves and porch. He lived here throughout his life. As a child Olsson was a loner. He often wandered by himself observing and drawing his surroundings. After school, Olsson sought employment at the National Railway Company, a job which didn’t really suit him. He later lost his job and, with a small amount of savings, registered at the Carl Wilhelmssons Painting School. He only spent a short time at the school, feeling uneasy in the company of colourful and expressive painters. He began to doubt his competence and was relieved when a lack of money forced him to leave. During the following years long periods of unemployment followed; however, he spent much of his time painting in secrecy, not showing his art to anyone. \n\nIn 1943 a department store organised a competition for young amateur painters. Olsson submitted six paintings, all of which were accepted. After positive responses from a couple of group showings it was time for Olsson’s first one-man show. The show opened in 1938 at Gallery Färg och Form in Stockholm and was a big success. The press and public were overwhelmed. The critics praised his colouristic talent and ability to bring to life the shabby suburbs in Hagalund.\n \nMore exhibitions followed in Scandinavia, including Copenhagen and Oslo, as well as in many Swedish cities. The artist was also represented at the Venice Biennale in 1942. As the years passed, Olsson chose to exhibit his work less often.

Born in Redhill, UK, Jonathan Parsons studied at Goldsmiths College, University of London, between 1989 and 1992. He has been working on an extended series of bright, multi-coloured grid paintings since 1995. He says of the works: ‘I am looking for a way to reduce a picture down to something like its fundamental constituents: brush marks; colours; configuration; illusion. They form a sort of generic type of picture in my practice, which encapsulates what interests me in painting: illusory pictorial depth; the flat surface; anti-composition; non-gesture. The brush marks in all of my grid paintings are – due to their implied impossibility, construction and artificial assembly – a sort of “portrait” of brush strokes. They are pictorial illusions, made with a brush. The apparent space that separates the orange and black marks in Instar, for example, implies that each successive notional layer does not lie flat over the preceding one. Therefore the picture becomes a depiction of space, which “falsifies” the flat painted stroke.’\n\nParsons’s work has been exhibited widely, being included in Charles Saatchi’s Sensation at the Royal Academy of Art, London, which then travelled to Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin and Brooklyn Museum of Art, New York (1997-9); his artwork formed part of the Hayward Gallery National Touring Exhibition’s British Art Show 5, (2000-1).

The piece, as its secondary title suggests, has been inspired by a seminal book, Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution (1969) by Brent Berlin and Paul Kay. In it Berlin and Kay proposed that in any culture the basic colour terms, such as black, brown or red, are predictable by the number of colour names the culture has. All cultures have names for black/dark and white/bright. If a culture has three colour terms the third is red. If a culture has four it has yellow or green. \nTaking this as his premise, the colours Parsons uses in Antiquity-Modernity-Contemporary refer to the basic colour terms (black, white, red, yellow and blue), and that the first four (black, white, red, yellow) are known as the colour palette of antiquity, while red, yellow and blue were the primary colours used by artists of the Modernist era.\nThe panels are painted in a way that shows the unfolding of the sequence, with colours ‘further down the list’ being polluted by drips of the colours that precede them, or in this case, that are vertically above them. The colour pollution takes the form of dripped and flowed paint that indexes the vertical flat surface of the panel, the liquid nature of the paint and its transition to a solid, and the sequence and manner in which the paints were applied. The dripping of the paint was not contrived or consciously elicited; it was simply allowed to happen and represents a true artefact of the painting process.

Born in Málaga to María Picasso y López and José Ruiz Blasco, an art teacher and minor painter, Pablo Picasso became the most famous and influential artist of the 20th century. Picasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age. According to his mother, his first words were ‘piz, piz’, a shortening of lápiz, the Spanish word for pencil. From the age of seven, Picasso received formal artistic training from his father in figure drawing and oil painting. Ruiz was a traditional, academic artist and instructor who believed that proper training required disciplined copying of the masters, and drawing the human body from plaster casts and live models.\n\nPicasso’s father sent the young artist to Madrid’s Royal Academy of San Fernando, the country’s foremost art school. At age 16, Picasso set off for the first time on his own, but he disliked formal instruction and quit attending classes soon after enrolment. Madrid, however, held many other attractions. The Prado housed paintings by Diego Velázquez, Francisco Goya and Francisco Zurbarán. Picasso especially admired the works of El Greco; elements like the elongated limbs, arresting colours, and mystical visages are echoed in his later work.','Verticale Brune 1 (Vertical Brown 1)',1447,'1447','Signed at right, dated behind with stamp, ‘Washington Studio, NY 1991’','20th Century',2100,'Gouache on paper,','Painted Brive-la-Gaillarde, France','60072','Edition 22/130',-1,2700,-1,81,70,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the US','','Mat staining, pale stains in margins, minor defects alongside edges of sheet.',NULL,108,1,187,1,1),(188,'Picasso made his first trip to Paris in 1900, then the art capital of Europe.

Soon they shared an apartment; Max slept at night while Picasso slept during the day and worked at night. These were times of severe poverty, cold and desperation. Much of his work was burned to keep the small room warm. During the first five months of 1901, Picasso lived in Madrid, where he and his anarchist friend Francisco de Asís Soler founded the magazine Arte Joven (Young Art), which published five issues. Soler solicited articles and Picasso illustrated the journal, mostly contributing grim cartoons depicting and sympathising with the state of the poor. The first issue was published on 31 March 1901, by which time the artist had started to sign his work simply Picasso.\n\nBy 1905, Picasso became a favourite of the American art collectors Leo and Gertrude Stein. Gertrude Stein became Picasso’s principal patron, acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal Salon at her home in Paris.

Derick Pobell was born in Munich in 1960 but between 1969 and 1971 he lived in Ithaca, New York, where his father was a physicist at Cornell University. During his time at the Academy for Photography in Munich (1982-4) he worked as a freelance assistant, travelling extensively during the vacations. Pobell began his professional photographic career working mainly for advertising agencies, including the commercial campaigns for major German car companies (BMW, Mercedes, Audi), banks (Deutsche Bank, HypoVereinsbank), eyeware (Rodenstock, Paloma Picasso), as well as brewery and computer companies (1984-2002). His photography has featured in Men’s Vogue, Stern and, unusually for a German photographer, in Interview, the magazine founded by Andy Warhol. \nPobell’s first kinetic sculpture was created in 1990: ‘Making mobiles was just a hobby. But more and more people who saw them at my place wanted to buy them which encouraged me to put more emphasis into this work. By 2009 I felt that I had developed my own style which was worth showing to the public.’ In 2012, Pobell moved to the countryside near Berlin, where he produces only a few unique objects, individually numbered and signed, every year. The mobile in this collection has the number 1203 in its title, and signature ‘Derick’ written and incised with a thin, black magic marker. The number refers to the year it was made (2012) and that it is the third sculpture of that year. Pobell has been represented by Marc Heiremans (Brussels), Kimcherova (New York), Modernity (Stockholm) and the Tony Subal Gallery (Vienna).','Artwork one',1455,'1455','Signed lower right','20th Century',17000,'Balsa wood and lacquered steel','Painted in Venice, Italy','60080','Edition 97/150',-1,18000,-1,156,217,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the Italy','','',NULL,110,1,195,1,1),(196,'Frenchpainter. Born in Russia, Serge Poliakoff arrived in Paris in 1923 and attended several of the Académies Libres. He moved to London in 1935 and attended the Slade School of Fine Art. His deep interest in painting techniques led him to examine Egyptian sarcophagi in the British Museum; their superimposition of colours, together with the example of Paul Cézanne and that of the Italian primitives in the Louvre, proved of great importance to him on his return to France. Among 20th-century painters he admired the purity and construction of space in the work of Juan Gris and the spirit of Paul Klee’s art. \n\nIn 1938 Poliakoff began to take an interest in abstract painting, more as a result of Otto Freundlich’s example than Wassily Kandinsky’s; but his full conversion took place through his meetings with Robert Delaunay, who in informal gatherings during this period used to explain to his painter friends his theory of simultaneous contrasts. Poliakoff’s interest in the specific properties and constructive possibilities of colour led him to produce his first abstract paintings, such as Abstract Composition (1938; artist’s collection).\n\nPoliakoff subsequently developed his exceptional gifts as a colourist, studying the material properties of colours, carrying out experiments to thicken the paint surface, and finally abandoning commercially produced paints in tubes in order to prepare his own in the manner of the Old Masters. At the same time, he superimposed layers of different colours like the Egyptians, so obtaining an inner light and intensity. In 1945 he held his first solo exhibition at the Galerie L’Esquisse in Paris and exhibited for the first time at the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles. In 1947 he was the first to be awarded the Prix Kandinsky, founded by Nina Kandinsky. Although already well established, Poliakoff achieved his mature style only in the late 1940s, for example in Composition (1948; New York, Guggenheim), by complementing his mastery of colour with a strong formal construction of the surface. He spoke of Byzantine painting as the canon by which he established an equilibrium between verticals and horizontals, between the centre and the edges of the painted surface, in paintings such as Abstract Composition (1956; London, Tate). His thoughts about art were outlined in Cahier Serge Poliakoff (1973, Saint-Gallen). Widely exhibited during the 1950s and 1960s, Poliakoff’s work has an important place in the Ecole de Paris and in post-war abstract painting. His late paintings, such as Composition in Black, Red, Yellow, White (1967; Paris, Gallery Melki), clearly demonstrate his continuing originality.','Te Voir Marcher est un Événement Énorme',1456,'1456','Signed lower right','20th Century',8100,'Oil on canvas','Painted Brive-la-Gaillarde, France','60081','Edition 28/70',-1,10000,-1,189,98,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the UK','','Mat staining, pale stains in margins, minor defects alongside edges of sheet.',NULL,111,1,196,1,1),(197,'British sculptor. Tom Price was born in London where he continues to live and work. Price’s video work has progressively explored the way in which the head and face can be used to construct and reveal character by utilising the techniques of stop-motion animation and the visual language of portraiture. Price’s sculptures revolve around the same pivotal ideas as his videos. The figures are constructed from an emotional context, with their physical attributes appropriated from various sources, both imagined and from the real world. The figures’ scale and high level of detail places them under the close scrutiny of the viewer, which slowly reveals the qualities that remove them from their seemingly Classical context. \n\nThe complexities of facial gestures and their associated responses have generated a response within Price’s work towards the simplification of these gestures. The animated faces may become more sophisticated and structurally complex, but their movements are constantly being refined, so as to achieve the greatest effect from the smallest movement. This drive for refinement has become an obsession where, with each reduction in gesture, inflections that are present become intensified so that a simple blink or tiny head movement becomes psychologically loaded.

Odilon Redon started his active artistic career after the Franco-Prussin War in which he served as a soldier. He regarded this experience as the catalyst that finally produced in him a firm sense of vocation. He settled in Paris in 1868and began to participate in the artistic and intellectual life there.When the term Symbolist became current as a description of the new art and literature in 1886,Redon was considered the major Symbolist artist. His works were widely debated in Symbolist reviews in Belgium as well as France, but Redon himself was alarmed at the excesses of many of these interpretations and maintained a discreet distance from such groups. \n\nHis chief literary ally wasStéphane Mallarmé, whom he met in 1883. Their friendship was close, although their only attempt at collaboration, Redon’s lithographs (1898) for Mallarmé’s Un coup de dés, was not completed. Redon has been termed ‘the Mallarmé of painting’. The transformation of nature into dream-like images, suggesting indefinite states of mind and expressed in sumptuous textures, remained his central concern, and the exploratory freedom with which he investigated the suggestive potential of colour contributed considerably to Post-Impressionist art. His innovations were admired by the Nabis and by some of the Fauves, including Henri Matisse. The Nabis were a group of painters formed in 1892 by Paul Serusier who admired Gaugin’s expressive use of colour and rhythmic pattern. The term Nabis is derived from the Hebrew word for prophets.','Head of Nothing',1458,'1458','Signed in pencil lower right','19th Century',2400,'Oil on panel','Painted in San Felice Circeo, Italy','60083','Edition 4/120',-1,3300,-1,80,92,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave France','','',NULL,113,1,198,1,1),(199,'From about 1890 Odilon Redon began to extend his use of colour, but his use of pastels also became frequent.

Earlier subject matter was reinterpreted, but new motifs also appeared, flowers, especially, becoming a central preoccupation. The increasingly decorative tone of these works led to commissions for screens and murals, an outstanding example being the 1910-1 paintings on the walls of the library at Fontfroide Abbey near Narbonne. \n\nRedon held his first Paris exhibitions at the time of the early lithograph albums, showing charcoal drawings at the review La Vie Moderne (1881) and in the newspaper Le Gaulois (1882). In 1884 he helped to organise the first Salon des Indépendants and in 1886 exhibited both at the last Impressionist Exhibition and with Les Vingt in Brussels. Although his Noirs charcoal drawings made little impact on the general public, they won acclaim among the Parisian literary avant-garde. The aesthetic principles underlying Redon’s art were close to those of Baudelaire, and summarised by the writer Paul Bourget in that, however great temporal corruption and decay may be, artistic ideals will transcend them. Emile Hennequin and Joris-Karl Huysmans became his champions; the Noirs figured in Huysmans’s decadent novel A rebours (1884, Paris).','Expansion',1459,'1459','Signed in white crayon and numbered 22/130, published by ABCD Editions.

Bridget Riley was born in Norwood, London, in 1931, and later studied at Goldsmith College, London University (1949-52) and the Royal College of Art (1952-5). She worked as an illustrator for J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, while initially painting in a pointillist style as encouraged by her mentor Maurice de Sausmarez (see Provenance). Citing the art of Georges Seurat as a major influence, Riley was also inspired by a large exhibition of Jackson Pollock held at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1958. \nExtending the optical effects of pointillism towards a more disorientating effect on the eye, Riley began to use simple shapes, such as squares, triangles and circles and distorting or rearranging them. This could create the effect of an undulating surface (such as Straight Curve; 1963); in Blaze 2 (1963; Belfast), a revolving tunnel effect emerged from spiraling black and white V-shapes; in Current (1964; New York, MoMA) a mass of parallel, but slightly curved, lines created the feeling of a strong wind passing over the canvas. These, together with most works produced between 1961-5, saw Riley work in black and white, the vivid contrast aiding their intense energy. \nIn 1965, Riley’s work was exhibited at MoMA, New York, as part of The Responsive Eye, an important show often said to have launched Op Art, a style of painting or sculpture that exploits the illusions or optical effects of perceptual processes.Untitled was completed the following year and exemplifies the direction that Riley’s work was beginning to take at this point in her career. It is one of the first instances where she utilises the curved line, a development that informs much of her output of the 1970s and is central to her exploration of colour and light. The piece is dedicated to Ben Nicholson, a fellow English artist whom Riley much admired. \n\nWtihin this exploration Riley adopted colour induction, often using white to infiltrate one colour into another, to either form a third colour or to limit the effect of the others. Black was also reintroduced extending the expressive range of the images, as is illustrated in Firmus (1972-3; London, Tate). During the 1980s Riley travelled to Egypt, inspiring the Ka and Ra series which reflect the colours of the Egyptian countryside. \n\nRiley was the first female to win the International Painting Prize at the Venice Biennale in 1968. She continues to have a prominent position in today’s art scene: Riley’s paintings took centre stage in the National Gallery’s New Paintings and Related Work exhibition in 2011; in 2012 she was the first woman to receive the Sikkens Prize, a prestigious Dutch art award that recognises the use of colour.','The First Empire',1460,'1460','Signed in white crayon and numbered 22/130, published by ABCD Editions.

From an early age Jean-Paul Riopelledrew extensively and painted landscapes from nature. From 1939 to 1941 he studied at Montreal Polytechnic while also taking a correspondence course in architecture. He temporarily abandoned painting in 1941, but from 1943 to 1945 he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Montreal and at the École du Meuble, where he spent most of his time. He and like-minded painters, later known as Les Automatistes, met regularly in the studio of Paul-Émile Borduas at the École du Meuble, to discuss their interest in abstract art, Surrealism and automatic techniques.\nRiopelle first visited Paris in 1946 and settled there a year later. He was included by André Breton and Marcel Duchamp in the last major group show of the Surrealist movement at the Galerie Maeght in 1947 and met Georges Mathieu, Maria Elena Vieira da Silva, Nicolas de Stäel among others. His own paintings, such as the Green Parrot (1949; Musée Québec), were tachiste in character, with wild, sweeping brushstrokes, but this gradually gave way to a technique in which blobs of paint were squeezed directly from the tube on to the canvas, their threads trailing across the surface so that they criss-cross in a number of directions. The dense, matted paint and gleaming colours have sometimes been interpreted as a memory of the dark Canadian forests that Riopelle knew well in his youth, but the paintings were executed in a trance-like state of intense improvisation.\nFrom the late 1950s most of Riopelle’s paintings were no longer completely abstract but took as a starting point representations of landscapes or animals, sometimes based on photographs or stuffed birds, which he treated in caricatural manner and often subjected to a process of virtual obliteration. He also began In 1958 he also began to model sculptures for casting in bronze, such as Don Quixote (1961; Washington, D.C., Hirshhorn), exhibiting them first in 1962. From1960 he employed a wider range of techniques and materials: not only sculpture but pastel, lithography, collage, enamel, acrylic and mosaic.

Born in Paris, George Rouault’s interest in the world of the circus found its greatest outlet in his art during the 1930s when Ambroise Vollard commissioned him to make etchings and woodcuts for the book Cirque de l\'Étoile Filante, published in 1938. These depictions were based on his own childhood memories of the circus, as he remembered them: ‘Acrobats and horsewomen, sparkling or passive clowns, tightrope walkers and freaks, and my friends, color and harmony, since my earliest childhood I have been in love with you’ (quoted in Bernard Dorival and Isabelle Rouault’s GeorgesRouault: l\'Oeuvre peint, Monte Carlo, 1988, vol. I, p. 153). \n\nRouault was particularly drawn to the clowns and their expressive potential as subjects for portraiture. These nomadic entertainers represented freedom and naïveté, and were for Rouault a release from his focus on the darker images of life. His series of clown portraits is marked by an emotional immediacy that is unique both within his oeuvre and the spectrum of modern art. Lionello Venturi writes: ‘When he paints clowns, however, the grotesque becomes amiable, even lovable... colours grow rich and resplendent, almost as if the artist, laying aside his crusader’s arms for a moment, were relaxing in the light of the sun and letting it flood into his work,’ (Lionello Venturi, Rouault, Lausanne, 1959, pp. 21 & 51).\n\nRouault’s use of black underpainting imbues the subject with a profound, almost spiritual, depth. He employs broad Expressionistic brushstrokes that deconstruct forms and bring his subject to the edge of abstraction. Rouault’s style was also greatly influenced by the work of Henri Matisse with whom he had exhibited at the Salon d’Automne in 1905 alongside other Fauvist artists.','Fotbollsspelar (Footballers)',1463,'1463','Marked Ron Arad for MAGIS, Made in Italy','20th Century',4600,'Oil on paper laid down onto canvas','Painted in Florence, Italy','60088','Edition 117/150',-1,6000,-1,70,80,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave France','','',NULL,117,1,203,1,1),(204,'French sculptor, writer, stage designer and filmmaker. Niki de Saint Phalle spent the first 20 years of her life in New York. A self-taught artist, on her return to Europe she began to work in a style similar to Art Brut. She first came to public attention through the Shots series of 1960-1, ironic parodies of Art Informel painting, comprising plaster reliefs incorporating pockets of paint, which burst when fired at by visitors to the exhibition, thus staining the surface. Through these works Saint Phalle became associated with Nouveau Réalisme. She produced reliefs and sculptures made of objets trouvés and plastic toys. Monsters and other fantastic creatures were also among her favourite themes (e.g. King Kong, 1963; Stockholm, Moderna Museet), while other assemblages were in the form of iconoclastic altars.\n\nSaint Phalle’s next series were concerned with the representation of women, as in the series of Brides (e.g. Bride, 1963; Paris, Pompidou). This led to the renowned Nanas series, begun in 1964; daubed in bright colours, the larger-than-life athletic females glorified an art of play and festivity. The apotheosis was the monumental She: A Cathedral (1966; Stockholm, Moderna Museet, destroyed); constructed in collaboration with Jean Tinguely, and Per Olof Ultveldt. It was a huge shell of a reclining woman, 28-metres long, inside which were rooms, including a cinema and a bar. It was Tinguely, who she had met in 1956 and began living with in 1964, who introduced her to Pontus Hulten, the Director of the ModernaMuseet in Stockholm, who organised many important exhibitions at that time, and bought some of Saint Phalle’s works for the museum.','Le Vase',1464,'1464','Signed at right, dated behind with stamp, ‘Washington Studio, NY 1991’','20th Century',2000,'Unique Sculpture in Resin','Painted in Venice, Italy','60089','Edition of 6',68,5300,-1,43,36,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the Germany','','Mat staining, pale stains in margins, minor defects alongside edges of sheet.',NULL,118,1,204,1,1),(205,'From the 1960s Saint Phalle devoted herself mainly to monumental sculptures, sometimes intended more directly for children: Fantastic Paradise (1967; Montreal, Expo ’67, French Pavillion, present whereabouts unknown; with Tinguely); The Golem (1972; Jerusalem; with Tinguely); Dragon (1973; Knokke-het-Zoute); the Stravinsky Fountain with its colourful vegetal forms (1983; Paris, Pompidou; with Tinguely). \n\nIn 1955 Saint Phalle had visited Barcelona, Spain where she discovered the work of Antoni Gaudi.These visits, and particularly Gaudi’s Park Güell, changed her life, and gave her the idea of creating a garden of sculpture which finally took its form with The Tarocchi Garden, which was begun in Tuscany in 1979.Not only was Gaudi’s work an inspiration butalso the spirit of the ‘monster’ garden at Bomarzo, in Lazio, Italy, which gave Saint Phalle the idea to conceive a fantasticgarden fullof imaginary creatures and dream architecture. \n\nThe TarocchiGarden was officially opened in 1998.In a section of the garden Saint Phalle made sculptures to represent 21 Tarot cards of which Angle of Temperance was card XIIII.Saint Phalle is quoted as saying “I had great difficulty understanding this card.It was too far from my passionate nature.Temperance seemed to me to be a compromise a middle road.

Anshelm Leonard Schultzberg was born in 1862 and studied in Stockholm at the Edward Perseus Technical School (1881) and the Academy of Fine Arts (1882-6). A celebrated artist, he specialised in winter landscapes, particularly around areas such as Dalarna, Varmland and Bergslagen, and sunlit apple trees covered in blossom. He was rewarded with a royal medal for Autumn Landscape and spent 1889-90 in France and 1891-2 in Italy around the Naples area, both the art and the landscapes of these countries influencing his style. The French Ruralist and Social Realist artists of the 1880s and their depiction of working men and women particularly struck a chord with Schultzberg and his contemporaries in Sweden. The painting techniques derived from artists such as Jules Bastien-Lepage and Schultzberg’s time in Grez-Sur-Loing, slowly gave way to a more Impressionistic and fluid style in his later years.\n\nSchultzberg received medals in Paris (1889) and in Chicago (1893) and was recognised at the 1904 World’s Fair in Saint Louis, USA for the structural design of the Swedish exhibition. These medals were issued at major art events around the world, normally with some prize money attached, for what were considered the most accomplished works of art for that particular exposition. Schultzberg represented Sweden on a number of occasions at international exhibitions, including Rome in 1911 and San Francisco in 1915. He is represented in many public collections including Nationalmuseum, Sweden and the Göteborgs Konstmuseum.','Artwork one',1474,'1474','Signed','20th Century',22800,'Oil on Canvas','Painted Brive-la-Gaillarde, France','60099','Edition 22/130',-1,16200,-1,81,70,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the Germany','','',NULL,121,1,214,1,1),(215,'German artist. Born and raised in Hanover, Germany, Kurt Schwitters’s most famous works are his Cubist-inspired assemblages, which he began to produce around 1918. Composed of bits of wood, newspaper and other debris, and often nailed or glued together, they came, according to the artist, from a desire to create new forms from the shattered remains of the pre-war world.Schwitters expanded his principles of assemblage to encompass other art forms, including poetry and performance, and coined the term ‘Merz’ as a generic word for his oeuvre. It was through his association with Der Sturm and his meeting with Hans Arp that he established contact with the Dadaists, although he never officially joined the movement after feuding with Richard Huelsenbeck, who excluded him from the Berlin wing. From this time,‘Merz’ became the name of Schwitters’s one-man movement and philosophy. The word derives from a fragment of the word ‘Kommerz’, used in an early assemblage for which Schwitters subsequently gave a number of meanings, the most frequent being that of ‘refuse’ or ‘rejects’. In 1919 he wrote: ‘The word “Merz” denotes essentially the combination, for artistic purposes, of all conceivable materials, and, technically, the principle of the equal distribution of the individual materials… A perambulator wheel, wire-netting, string and cotton wool are factors having equal rights with paint.’ Such materials were indeed incorporated in Schwitters’s large assemblages and painted collages of this period. \n\nAfter 1923 his work was influenced by De Stijl and Constructivism. In the same year he began his magnum opus, the extraordinary Merzbau. It was a vast sculptural construction which took over part of the artist’s home and studio in Hanover and remained unfinished when he left Germany in December 1936. He had spoken early in his career of his ‘ultimate aspiration’ being ‘the union of art and non-art in the Merz total world view’. The refuse and objets trouvés of his assemblages, collected and stored with a manic passion in suitcases and specially made wooden boxes, became the cult objects of what was, in Max Ernst’s words, ‘a huge abstract grotto’, made around and within a basic structure of wire, wood and plastered struts. The Merzbau was in effect an elaborate autobiographical ‘growth’ of interconnecting grottos, in which pieces of friends’ clothing, hair and even the artist’s own bottled urine were placed alongside a host of other bizarre objects stored in compartments and behind secret panels. It was entirely destroyed by an Allied bomb in 1943. Forced to flee Nazi persecution in 1937, Schwitters moved first to Norway and then in 1940 to Britain, where he later died in obscurity.','Te Voir Marcher est un Événement Énorme',1475,'1475','Signed in pencil lower right','20th Century',1300,'Collage on paper','Painted in Turin, Italy','60100','Edition 22/130',-1,1600,-1,81,70,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the Italy','','',NULL,122,1,215,1,1),(216,'Swedish painter.

He then left for Copenhagen where through artistic circles he discovered the Parisian avant-garde.In 1918 and 1919 he participated in exhibitions at Liljevalchs Gallery, Stockholm, showing several Cubist paintings to great acclaim. His success caught the attention of the art dealer Gösta Olson who then championed his work and funded Sköld to travel to Paris with his wife Arna. In Paris, Sköld abandoned Cubist painting, which had occupied him during the early part of the 20thcentury and instead developed a new naïve style, which in Sweden came to be known as ‘Nysaklighet’.\n\nA recurring theme in his paintings during the years in Paris was the city itself. He often portrayed the city’s rooftops, cafés and bars. A typical example can be found in the Stockholm Moderna Museet, entitled Rooftops in Paris and painted in 1921-2, where the grey-black roofs and house façades contrast with the buildings’ vivid red and jet-black chimneys against the bright, hazy sky. In Paris he attended the Académie Scandinave before returning to Sweden in 1929 where he founded a school of painting together with Åke Pernby. Sköld was Director of the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm between 1950 and 1958 where he developed the Moderna Museet in the old drill hall on Skeppsholem in Stockholm.Previously Pablo Picasso’s Guernica and the 93 attendant sketches had been exhibited there prior to the Museum’s creation.

Pierre Soulages was greatly impressed as a boy by the Celtic carvings in the museum at Rodez, Aveyron, in southern France where he was born,as well as by the architecture and sculpture of the Romanesque Abbey of Sainte-Foy at Conques. In 1938 he went to Paris for the first time, where he visited the Louvre and saw exhibitions of Paul Cézanne and Pablo Picasso. With the intention of training to be a drawing teacher, he enrolled in a studio in Paris but was encouraged instead to enter the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts. He was, however, bitterly disappointed by what was being taught there, which seemed to fall far short of what he had just seen, so he returned to Rodez. The paintings he was making at this time were of leafless trees in winter, the black branches forming a tracery against the sky. He was called up in 1941 but demobilised almost at once. He was able to do very little painting during the Occupation, but it was here he became aware of abstract art through his friendship with Sonia Delaunay.\n\nSoulages’s career as a painter dates from 1946, when he moved to Courbevoie outside Paris. His earliest abstract pictures are of broad straight and curved brushstrokes like bars forming a compact and centralised image against a white background. These were followed by paintings in oil, often on a much larger scale, with heavy black bar-like strokes overlaying patches of white or colour. Although their severe, monumental character and preoccupation with black set them apart from almost all other Parisian abstract painting of the time, he was soon recognised internationally as one of the major figures in the post-war abstract movement.','Head of Nothing',1477,'1477','Signed in white crayon and numbered 22/130, published by ABCD Editions.

Nicolas de Staël was born in Russia to an aristocratic family forced into exile in 1919 as a result of the Russian Revolution. In 1922, orphaned, he and his sisters were sent to Brussels to live with wealthy Russian expatriates. Between 1933 and 1936 he studied in Brussels, attending courses on architecture at the Académie de St. Giles and in decoration and design at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts. In August 1937 he met the painter Jeannine Guillou who became his companion until her death (1946). Together they travelled to Algeria and Italy, where de Staël applied himself to studies of Italian art, returning to Paris in 1938. There he made copies after Old Master paintings in the Musée du Louvre, especially those of Chardin and Delacroix; in the summer months he painted landscapes in Brittany.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II he served with the Foreign Legion until he was demobilised in 1940, when he rejoined Guillou in Nice, France. There they became part of a lively circle of avant-garde artists, including Alberto Magnelli and Sonia Delaunay, who influenced the direction of his work. It was here that de Staël first abandoned direct representation in his work, although he continued to refer obliquely to the formal rhythms of real objects. Returning to Paris he held his first one-man show at the Galerie L’Esquisse, followed by an exhibition in a mixed show at the Galerie Jeanne Bucher (see Provenance above) in 1945. Through Bucher’s gallery he befriended another Russian emigré painter, André Lanskoy, whose example led him to use thick paint and to develop a rich and textured surface, as illustrated in Hard Life (1946; Paris, Pompidou).\n\nIn 1948 deStaël acquired French citizenship and began to receive considerable notices. The title Paysage (as above) became more and more present in his work as of 1952, replacing that of Composition. His friendship with poet René Char at this time encouraged his inclination to rediscover what he referred to as his childhood passion for vast skies. The series of exquisite landscapes painted in and around Paris and the Normandy seascapes that followed are reminiscent in their use of low horizons of the Flemish and Dutch landscapes he admired in his youth. Never simply reproducing the forms of nature, he gave them pictorial structure through the tactile quality of the paint. De Staël did not consider abstraction and representation to be in opposition with each other, especially as natural phenomena consistently provided the basis for his paintings.

Seascapes, more so than any other subject, allowed him to go beyond the dichotomy of abstract-figurative art. Marine à Dieppe (Plage) was painted in 1952, the year in which de Staël painted a large number of seascapes.This painting presents a succession of bands of colour placed horizontally. The subject participates in this ambiguity between abstract and figurative art by bringing them together. The composition, very sober and reduced to a few lines, as well as the space constructed from different areas of colour, are sufficient to render the essence of the seascape. A wonderful colourist, de Staël presents us with an extraordinary variation of blues, from deep navy through to emerald tints, the flat areas of white bringing out the radiance of the colour by giving it structure.\nBetween 1952 and 1955, de Staël travelled often, executing different series of landscapes in which, at each occasion, the visual components were totally changed if not turned upside down. He went to London, New York, the north of Italy, down the Italian peninsula as far as Sicily, across to Spain, as well as finding time to visit Paris and the north and south of France. Light, matter, coloured forms and the conception of the composition of his work changed radically according to his subject: landscapes of Normandy or the south of Italy, for example. The local light, relived by the artist, was a fundamental element in his landscapes which started with the blues and greys of Paris and the north of France.\nDe Staël’s brilliance has left a long-lasting mark in art history. At his premature death in 1955, at the age of 41, he had executed in all some 1,100 paintings and circa 1,200 works on paper.','The First Empire',1479,'1479','Signed in white crayon and numbered 22/130, published by ABCD Editions.

He also designed illustrations for a collection entitled Stories of Mining Districts by Carl Larsson.

Born in Stockholm in 1849, August Johan Strindberg never had a formal art training but rather learnt from artist friends after falling out of the University of Uppsala in 1872. In addition to his writing, Strindberg pursued any number of eccentric interests, including occultism, Swedenborgianism (The New Church) and alchemy. However, Strindberg’s paintings offered vehicles for his belief that chance played a crucial part in the creative process and were unique for their time, going beyond those of his contemporaries for their radical lack of adherence to visual reality. \n\nThe 117 paintings that are acknowledged as his, were mostly painted within the span of a few years, and are now seen by some as among the most original works of 19th-century art. Today, his best-known pieces are stormy, Expressionist seascapes. Though Strindberg was friends with Edvard Munch and Paul Gauguin, and was thus familiar with modern trends, the spontaneous and subjective expressiveness of his landscapes and seascapes can be ascribed also to the fact that he painted only in periods of personal crisis. After he stopped painting in 1874 he became Sweden’s leading art critic, as well as the ideological leader of the radical Swedish artists’ movement, which in 1884 formed the Konstnärsförbund (the Artists’ Association) in protest against Stockholm’s Academy of Art. Prominent among its members were the painters Carl Olof Larsson, Karl Nordström and Richard Bergh.\n\nStrindberg changed his field of activity time and again when he saw obstacles within the area of his current work. Painting became an alternative means of expression when other paths, particularly in his writing, seemed to be closed. A prolific writer who often drew directly on his personal experience, Strindberg’s career spanned four decades, during which time he wrote over 60 plays and more than 30 works of fiction, autobiography, history, cultural analysis and politics. A bold experimenter and iconoclast throughout, he explored a wide range of dramatic methods and purposes, from naturalistic tragedy and history plays, to his anticipations of Expressionist and Surrealist dramatic techniques.','Colour Motion',1481,'1481','Signed at right, dated behind with stamp, ‘Washington Studio, NY 1991’','19th Century',3400,'Oil on zinc plate','Painted in Florence, Italy','60019','Edition 35/300',-1,2500,-1,73,88,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the UK','','Mat staining, pale stains in margins, minor defects alongside edges of sheet.',NULL,127,1,221,1,1),(222,'Having resumed painting again on Dalarö in the Stockholm archipelago in 1892, August Johann Strindberg hosted his own one-man exhibition at the Birger Jarls Bazar in Stockholm. This was made up almost exclusively of more spontaneous depictions of the sea and its storms, with pure oils applied directly onto canvas or panels and obvious use of the palette knife. This same year saw Strindberg move to Berlin where he associated himself with Scandinavian and German writers and artists, including the young Edvard Munch with whom he exhibited at the Salon des Refusés in Berlin (1893). \n\nAfter his second marriage to Austrian journalist Frida Uhl, he painted several semi-abstract paintings in Dornach, Austria, such as the large Wonderland (1894; Stockholm, Nordiska Museet), before travelling to Paris in the autumn of 1894 to work as a playwright and arts journalist. This was also the year in which Strindberg created his two most abstract paintings: Snowstorm at Sea (Stockholm, Nordiska Museet) and Heavy Sea. A year later he held his final Parisian exhibition, at Hôtel Drouot, which included his letter to close friend Paul Gauguin published in the sale catalogue.\n\nStrindberg did not resume painting again until 1901, after a serious breakdown in his third marriage to Norwegian-Swedish actress Harriet Bosse (see Provenance). Strindberg’s style now illustrated a symbolic undertone of death and destruction with vivid skies, as is illustrated in The Wave (1901; Paris, Musée d’Orsay) and The City (1903; Stockholm, Nordiska Museet). These emotive undertones can also be depicted via romantic motifs of the forest, such as in this example, The Birch Tree I (Autumn), painted in Stockholm in 1902, and The Spruce Forest (1905; Stockholm, Nordiska Museet) which, by all accounts, seems to be the last example of Strindberg’s painting. Beyond 1905 he focused on photography and playwriting, and did not truly make his name as an artist in his lifetime.

He only began to find his way as a painter in 1934 when he first made a visit to Pembrokeshire, Wales, a source of repeated inspiration. He began to make drawings and watercolours in a sketchbook thathe could work up in his studio and became fascinated by objets trouvés such as root forms and fragments of thorn brushes that demonstrated the principles of organic growth. Not only did the objects take on a metamorphic character, with suggestions of animal or human forms, but their dramatic impact was enhanced by rich, emotive colour.\n\nFrom 1940to 1945 Sutherland was employed as an Official War Artist to make depictions, mainly drawings, of bomb damage in south Wales and London, blast furnaces, tin mining in Cornwall, limestone quarrying, opencast coal mining, and, finally, after the liberation of France, views of the bomb damage done by the RAF to railway marshalling yards and flying bomb depots. His pictures of air-raid devastation in London are among the most vivid and memorable records of the Blitz. In 1946 Sutherland painted a large Crucifixion for the church of \nSt Matthew, Northampton.It was both his first life-size representation of the human figure and the first of several paintings on religious themes, it was preceded by a series of studies of thorn trees and thorn heads suggested by the image of the crown of thorns.\n\nHaving visited the south of France for the first time in 1947, Sutherland then spent part of each year there. From 1949 to 1957 he worked on a series of ‘standing forms’ in which shapes developed from fragments of roots and trees were placed upright, sometimes two or three in a row, against a background such as a hedge; each form was intended to evoke the presence of a human figure.\n\nReturning to Pembrokeshire in 1967 for the first time in over 20 years, Sutherland found, to his surprise, that the landscape there had just as much fascination for him as ever. As a result, almost all of his nature paintings from then on were based once again on Pembrokeshire themes.

His works, whether as a black-and-white artist, painter, book illustrator or writer, are marked by a strong sense of reality with a particular empathy for the environment and lives of the fishing population.

In 1637 he married Anna, the daughter and heiress of Jan Breughel the Elder. From the outset, Teniers the Younger was an extremely productive painter thanks to his good relationship with Antwerp art dealers. During the 1630s he produced small-format religious scenes on commission for Chrysostoom van Immerseel who supplied the Spanish market. However, it was Teniers’s genre pieces that were greatly prized by the Antwerp dealers and made him famous.\n\nTeniers quickly became one of Antwerp’s most successful painters, which probably accounts for his assumption of functions that carried a degree of social prominence, such as the office of Master of the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament in the St Jacobskerk, Antwerp, between 1637 and 1639, and Dean of the Guild of St Luke in 1644-5. He also received such prestigious commissions as the large group portrait, Arquebusiers’ Company (1643; St Petersburg, Hermitage). During this same Antwerp period he also executed commissions for Antonine Triest, the Bishop of Bruges, one of the most prominent patrons of the arts in the southern Netherlands.

He consequently moved from Antwerp to the court at Brussels and, in 1656, bought a building near the archducal palace and had it rebuilt as a spacious and handsome house and studio.\n\nThe present picture shows an alchemist in his laboratory as he consults his book of formulae.The intention of alchemy was to turn base metal into gold by the addition of the ‘philosopher’s stone’.Although the practice was scientifically flawed, and often considered heretical, the techniques used, such as distillation and metallurgy, contributed a great deal to the development of science and industry.The 17th century witnessed a significant tension between religious beliefs and the scientific advances which would eventually become the Enlightenment.When the effect of this scientific revolution acted in combination with the rise in the popularity of ‘genre painting’, the number of representations of alchemists greatly increased.Teniers was at the forefront of this style of genre painting and the Alchemist’s assistants, who are ostensibly grinding raw materials, more closely resemble card players or drinkers in a tavern in many of his other compositions.','Modul Skulptur i Färg B19 (Module Sculpture in Colour B19)',1486,'1486','Signed ‘GAN’ and dated ‘28.

Theodor Esaias Thorén was born in Halmstad, Sweden in 1901, to a father who made fine furniture. Inspired by the art of Gösta Adrian-Nilsson (GAN),which he first saw as a teenager, Thorén began painting. During the early 1920s, he also experimented with wooden sculptures and reliefs in his father’s workshop. With fellow artist Sven Jonson he formed The Young duo in 1923 under the tutelage of Axel Olson; the duo exhibited in Halmstad a year later. In 1925 Thorén attended Carl Wilhelmson’s private art school in Stockholm before travelling with Jonson to Paris to study under Otte Sköld. But they both returned to Halmstad in the spring of 1927, opening a combined atelier and painting school that attracted the town’s artists and intellectuals.\n\nThorén finally met Adrian-Nilsson in 1928, the year in which Konstruktion VIII was created. By 1929 he became a founding member of the influential Halmstad Group (Halmstadgruppen) along with brothers Axel and Erik Olson, their cousin Waldemar Lorentzon, Stellan Mörner and Sven Jonson. The group was influenced in particular by Salvador Dalí and Yves Tanguy. By the end of the decade Thorén shifted from a predominantly post-Cubist style to Purism (an admiration for the beauty and structural purity of the machine) and concrete art. \n\nHe returned to study in 1931, this time, doing graphics at the Royal Swedish Academy of Art in Stockholm. His paintings became more Purist in composition while his sculptural objects and reliefs, under the influence of Adrian-Nilsson, displayed a Futuristic spirit. Along with most of the members of the Halmstad Group, Thorén’s output adopted a Surrealist approach as was revealed when he participated in the bold Kubisme-Surrealisme exhibitionin Copenhagen (1935) and further international Surrealist shows in London (1936 and 1937) and Paris (1938). \n\nWithout abandoning but rather modifying Surrealism, Thorén’s output of the 1940s and early 1950s became more eclectic and politically conscious. He joined the Söndrum Colony, an association of artists (Sven Erixson or ‘X-et’, Felix Hatz and Vilhelm Bjerke Petersen), poets (Elsa Grave) and academics (Erik Lindegren) based on the Halmstad coastal strip.

Luis Tomasello was born in 1915 in La Plata, Argentina, and studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires.

He made his first trip to Europe in 1945, followed by others including a visit in 1951, to Sicily, the island from which his father had emigrated. He has cited being particularly inspired by the paintings of Piet Mondrian and the medieval stained glass of Chartres Cathedral. In 1954 he formed the New Art Association in Buenos Aires, with, among others, Surrealist-promoting art critic Aldo Pellegrini and Argentinian-German sculptor Martin Blaszko. \n\nAfter settling in Paris in 1957, Tomasello exhibited with a group of artists whose explorations took them from constructivist abstraction to cinetism, an art form founded on optical illusion fashionable during 1950-1963. He was promoted by the avant-garde Galerie Denise René in Paris and soon his works were hung in several national and international exhibitions of Op Art, including the landmark show La Lumière et le Mouvement (1967). A year later, Tomasello created this Atmosphère Chromoplastiques No. 194, one of a series of images for which he is particularly known.

From 1878 onwards, Tournes successfully exhibited at the Salon des Artistes Français and Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts. Tournes is represented in many of the museums in France and abroad, in particular the Musée d’Orsay, Paris (La Toilette), the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Bordeaux (Jeune Femme se Peignant) and the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Dijon (La Première Communiante).\n\nThe painting shown here, which commemorates the Bastille Day celebrations in 1889, captures the exuberant demonstration of national pride. The presence of the Republican Guard in the right-hand corner alludes to the military parade held every Bastille Day since 1880 when Benjamin Raspail proposed a law to have ‘the Republic choose the 14 July as a yearly national holiday’. It was subsequently decreed that this day ‘should be celebrated with all the brilliance that the local resources allow’. Charles Rearick provides a compelling account of the palpable excitement that pervaded the first Bastille Day in 1880: ‘A warm, sunny day, it was a holiday unlike any other. Not even a rainstorm in the evening could spoil it. In Paris it had begun with a volley of cannon shots at 8am; in the country, several hours earlier, villagers had awakened to fanfares of rifle fire and ringing church bells; firecrackers and band music followed. Streets were bedecked with flags and bunting, and in some places banners, garlands and triumphal arches as well. Parts of central Paris became a gala stage set, a sparkling mosaic of red, white and blue. At night, gas lamps and electric lights and Venetian lanterns brought a rare cheering radiance to main streets and squares. Fireworks from six locations emblazoned and bombarded the sky. No one could take July 14, 1880 as just another day.’ (Pleasures of the Belle Epoque, Yale University, 1988, p. 3).\n\nTournes captures the collective energy ofthe vibrant holiday. He successfully employs a ground-level perspective to emphasise the density of the raucouscrowd, forcing the viewer into the scene. This dramatic viewpoint was perhaps influenced by the development of photography.Tournes also emphasises the mingling of many different Parisian social classes and genders, a pictorial technique which is a distinctly late 19th-century phenomenon linked with the advent of modern society.','Inspiration',1490,'1490','Signed lower right','19th Century',25000,'Oil on canvas','Painted in Florence, Italy','1007','Edition 22/130',-1,18400,-1,81,70,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the Italy','','',NULL,135,1,230,1,1),(231,'Swedish painter.

Born in Korea in 1936, Lee Ufan initially studied Oriental painting at Seoul National University before settling in Japan in 1956 where he majored in philosophy at Nihon University, Toyko. By the late 1960s, Lee emerged as the theoretical leader of Mono-ha (School of Objects), Japan’s first contemporary art movement to gain international recognition. Mono-ha surpassed modernism by rejecting Western notions of representation, expression and intervention, preferring to include unprocessed objects in work, while focusing on the relationship between materials used. \n\nThrough his creations, Lee questions the supreme role of the artist as main agent. His titles are limited to Relatum, From Point, From Line and Correspondence, all of which are based on the Mono-ha theory. Lee’s sculptures present arrangements of stones together with industrial materials like steel plates, rubber sheets and glass panes. In both his early painting series, From Point and From Line (1972-84) Lee applied repeated dots or lines – with a soft-haired brush used for Oriental painting – onto canvas used in Western painting. The result reveals the characters of pigments but does not apply paint to the surface as the artist would expect. \n\nIn 1991 Lee began his series of Correspondence paintings, which consist of just one or two grey-blue brushstrokes, made up of oil and crushed stone pigment, applied onto a large white surface. Paintings within this series vary in size from a few inches to ten feet per side and can take Lee up to a month to finish. He completes no more than 25 works a year.\nIn 1969 and 1973 Lee represented Korea in the São Paulo Biennal, but it was his Resonance exhibition at Palazzo Palumbo Fossati during the 2007 Venice Biennale that won him critical acclaim and an international audience.

He studied in Budapest at the Podolini-Volkmann Academy of Painting (1925-7) and under Alexander Bortnyk at the Mühely Academy, also known as the Budapest Bauhaus (1929-30). There Vasarely became aware of the formal and geometrical language that masters of the original Bauhaus (Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee and László Moholy-Nagy) had employed in their courses for artists and designers. Vasarely moved to Paris in 1930, working for the next decade as a commercial artist, mainly designing posters.\n\nIaca is a prime example of a piece from the period in which Vasarely painted primarily in black and white (1951-65) and where our eyes are presented with contradictory data as we read part of the field in terms of diagonals and other parts in terms of horizontals and verticals.','Te Voir Marcher est un Événement Énorme',1494,'1494','Signed in white crayon and numbered 22/130, published by ABCD Editions.

From 1944 Vasarely devoted himself exclusively to painting, holding his first one-man exhibition at the Galerie Denise René, Paris (see Provenance), in the same year. During the 1940s and 1950s Parisian art was dominated by Tachism, an abstract style more akin to American Expressionism in its abandonment of geometric abstraction in favour of a more intuitive form of expression.

The brothers were encouraged to paint in their spare time by their employer. \n\nHaving served in the Red Cross during the First World War, Geer took a walking tour around Flanders, painting signs to earn a living.

Kramers continued to help both brothers financially until the effects of the Great Depression made it no longer viable. Geer acquired his own studio in 1926 and between 1928 and 1932 the van Veldes exhibited at the city’s annual Salon des Indépendants. In 1937 Geer met the Irish writer Samuel Beckett who became a lifelong friend and who often wrote texts to accompany Geer’s exhibitions.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful show at Guggenheim Jeune, London (1938), he moved to Cagnes-sur-Mer where he lived until 1944, working intensely. At this time Geer became more attracted to Cubism. He began his Intérieurs series, with a window-picture opening on to the sea through which he explored the inside-outside dialogue. The very specific light of the south of France had a definitive influence on Geer’s work, with soft, pastelly, often taupe tones invading the entire canvas. When he returned to Paris to live permanently at Cachan from 1944, the influence of the tender light of Ile-de-France continued to compliment these tones, as is illustrated in this Composition of 1951. The vigour yet gentleness of his paintings has been likened to that of the Impressionist-Cubist work of Jacques Villons. \n\nGeer met Dutch painter and exhibitor Piet Moget (see Provenance) in 1952 when the latter was living in Port-la-Nouvelle, southern France. This was the year in which Moget launched a series of exhibitions of other European artists; as well as Geer, these included such luminaries as de Staël, Poliakoff, Léger and Tanguy.

He needed a plain background, which would absorb... he drew the main rhythms and masses in charcoal, then covered the entire surface of the canvas with a thin coat of white zinc, with oil applied very dry, without thinner. The charcoal lines remained just visible. He then stuck on newspapers to absorb the oil...

He was brought up in a musical environment: his father was a violin teacher and his mother a piano teacher. Growing up at Le Vésinet near Paris, from 1892 he began to take an interest in painting, although he also worked as a mechanic and became a racing cyclist. As a largely self-taught artist, Vlaminck freed colour from its purely descriptive function, using broad, turbulent brushstrokes in a kind of proto-Expressionism, but he very quickly graduated to the Fauvist style that he practised from 1904 to 1907.\n\nAfter meeting André Derain in 1900, Vlaminck shared a studio with him on the Île de Chatou, a suburb about nine miles (14 km) southwest of Paris, flanked on the east by the Seine. Working side by side, they produced some of their greatest works in the Fauve style. In fact, Chatou plays a key role in the history of Fauvist painting. The winter of 1907 had been especially cold and snowy, but in the present painting the earliest signs of spring are already indicated by the first green shoots pushing up among the piles of melting snow. Vlamnick’s sweeping strokes of green pigment, together with the red indications of the roofs in the distance, contrast with the white snow and the black trees trunks set in perspective.

Similarities in the work produced during these years by Derain and Vlaminck in particular were not coincidental, since they had shared the same studio and often painted scenes depicting their immediate surroundings. Vlaminck’s boldest paintings of the period include his Portrait of Derain in which the face is vermilion, the Restaurant de la Machine à Bougival (circa 1905; Paris, Musée d’Orsay) and The Red Trees (1906; Paris,Pompidou).\n\nThe impact on Vlaminck of the Vincent van Gogh exhibition of 1901, where he was introduced to Matisse by Derain, was succeeded in 1907 by that of the Paul Cézanne retrospective. In response to these stimuli, Vlaminck moved away from his use of colour towards a concern with structure. At the same time he developed a dramatic view of landscape that was to remain a hallmark of his work. Vlaminck remained consistently hostile to Cubism, instead developing a more naturalistic treatment of landscape, retaining his vigorous style but using more austere colours.','Flat Standing Figure',1503,'1503','Signed ‘GAN’ and dated ‘28.

Brought up in Paris in modest circumstances, Édouard Vuillard attended the Lycée Condorcet where his contemporaries included the musician Pierre Hermant and the writer Pierre Véber, as well as Maurice Denis. His closest friend was Ker-Xavier Roussel, and, on leaving school in 1885, Roussel encouraged Vuillard to join him at the studio of the painter Diogène Maillart, where they received the rudiments of artistic training. Vuillard began to frequent the Louvre and soon determined on an artistic career, breaking the family tradition of a career in the army.\nIn March 1886 Vuillard entered the Académie Julian in Paris where he was taught by Tony Robert-Fleury, and on his third attempt in July 1887 he passed the entrance examination to the École des Beaux-Arts. He was taught by Jean-Léon Gérôme for a brief period of about six weeks in 1888, but his studies were spasmodic. In 1889 Vuillard was persuaded by Maurice Denis to join a small dissident group of art students that referred to itself as the brotherhood of Nabis. Paul Sérusier the French painter who founded the Nabis group with Denis, Bonnard, Vuillard and othershad communicated to his fellow artists his knowledge of the Synthetist method of painting; this entailed a reliance on memory and imagination rather than direct observation, and the application of forms and colours reduced to their simplest as equivalents to sensations and emotions received from nature. At first Vuillard was reluctant to accept the idea that the painter should not seek to reproduce realistically what he saw, although during 1890 he made his first bold experiments in Synthetist painting. His most important series of colour lithographs, Landscapes and Interiors, was published in 1899. After 1914 he exhibited infrequently and his subsequent works remained largely unknown until 1938, the time of his retrospective exhibition at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs. Vuillard died at la Baule, in western France in 1940, while escaping from the German invasion.','Modul Skulptur i Färg B19 (Module Sculpture in Colour B19)',1505,'1505','Signed ‘GAN’ and dated ‘28.

The artist once said, ‘I live in the belly of the beast, in the midst of welfare’, and his early art aired his fury with unjustly distributed resources and political violations.\n\nZennström’s oeuvre challenges the opinions and norms of contemporary social society. The works combine figuration with bold abstraction and elements of Pop Art so prevalent in America during the 1960s. His art took a new direction in the 1980s with the use of intense colour combinations leading to a greater degree of abstraction. One of the works from this period, The Secret(1981), was acquired by the Moderna Museet, Stockholm. \n\nDuring the 1980s and the 1990s Zennström developed his painting and his distinctive and unique imagery. Strong colours and organic forms expanded over the surface of the image and the paintings moved from the figurative to the abstract. The paintings no longer commented on a specific political or ideological conflict, but rather related to them. Hidden in the painting, on an implicit level, there is an examination of contemporary life, which is at times difficult to come to terms with. With time, the form of the painting has come to dominate over the explicit message and there is a desire for beauty in colour and shapes. In later works, the paintings have their origin in one of two fundamental forms: the upside down and the mirrored image. The colours are no longer the earlier, bright primary colours but rather a more dull range of brown shades.\n\nZennström’s work reveals, concerns and upsets. His motifs show an artist with a strong and sincere commitment against social, political and economic injustice. The work creeps under the skin of the viewer thanks to the tense mood and the black humour. More recently, the direct political and ideological references have given way to a more implicit agenda and a stronger abstract imagery. The works do, nonetheless, still hold references to a world order that is rarely pleasant, but important, both emotionally and intellectually. \n\nZennström has exhibited widely in both Sweden and abroad. He is represented in Sweden at, among others, Moderna Museet, Stockholm, the National Museum, Stockholm, Borås Konstmuseum, Göteborgs Konstmuseum, Moderna Museet, Malmö, Norrköpings Museum, Samtidsmuseet i Oslo, Sundsvalls Museum and the Kalmar Konstmuseum.','Expansion',1516,'1516','Signed lower left','21st Century',10400,'Oil on board','Painted in London, UK','60015','Edition 28/70',-1,20200,-1,189,98,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the UK','','Mat staining, pale stains in margins, minor defects alongside edges of sheet.',NULL,143,1,256,1,1),(257,'Swedish mixed-media artist. Nisse Zetterberg was born in Stockholm, 1910, into an artistic family: his father was a painter (Albert Zetterberg, 1883-1955), and his brother, born a year earlier, became an architect (Olle Zetterberg). Initially he learnt painting with his father, then studied at the College of Art, Stockholm (1929-34), under the varied tutelage of artist, writer and cartoonist Albert Engström, painter and printmaker Olle Hjortzberg and modernist painter Birger Simonsson. This paid off: Zetterberg worked primarily in painting and printmaking, but also in sculpture and decorative work, taking note of the current practices used in countries that he visited, including France, Holland, Belgium and England. \nZetterberg is perhaps most famous for his mixed-media work at Rinkeby subway station, Stockholm, which opened in 1975 and was supplemented in 1985. Capitalising on the runestone-rich area surrounding Stockholm, Zetterberg created, within rust-red rock walls, glistening gold mosaics of local finds excavated from Viking times. The other two artists involved in the station’s decor were Sven Sahlberg, whose large sun of gold with petals of oars hangs from the ceiling, and Lennart Grams, whose paintings of birds flying in the direction of the trains, adorn the track wall. \n\nOther public artworks by Zetterberg are included in Malmö City Library, a bank in Köping, the chancel windows in Torsåkers Church near Uppsala (1965) and a decorative frieze in Åvaskolan, Täby (1973).','The First Empire',1517,'1517','Signed lower left','20th Century',4800,'Mixed media montage','Painted in Florence, Italy','60036','Edition 2/70',-1,4000,-1,189,98,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the US','','Mat staining, pale stains in margins, minor defects alongside edges of sheet.',NULL,144,1,257,1,1),(258,'Swedish painter, etcher and sculptor. Anders Zorn was brought up by his grandparents at Mora. As he displayed a precocious talent for drawing he was admitted to the preparatory class of the Kungliga Akademien för de Fria Konsterna, Stockholm, at the age of 15. Dissatisfied with the outdated teaching and discipline of the Academy and encouraged by his early success as a painter of watercolour portraits and genre scenes (e.g. Old Woman from Mora, 1879; Zorn Museum, Mora), Zorn left the Academy in 1881 to try to establish an international career. He later resided mainly in London but also travelled extensively in Italy, France, Spain, Algeria and the Balkans and visited Constantinople. However, he continued to spend most of his summers in Sweden.\n\nSommarnöje was paintedat Dalarö in the archipelago outside Stockholm. This had been a very popular and picturesque summer residence since the end of the 19thcentury. Dalarö was an important place for Anders and Emma Zorn, Emma’s family rented a house here during the summer months from the coastal pilot Carl Gustav Dahlström – the man depicted in the boat. Emma and Anders married in 1885 and went to Dalarö at the beginning of the summer of 1886. Zorn found his inspiration and motifs in the surrounding environment and created several of his masterpieces here including Sommarnöje.','Figure',1518,'1518','Signed ‘GAN’ and dated ‘28.

Here he began to gain international recognition thanks partly to his portraits and partly to his pictures of nudes (Une Première, 1888; Stockholm, National Museum, and Out of Doors, 1888; Göteborg, Konstmuseum). Zorn adopted the innovative practice of painting nudes en plein air. The virtuoso technique that he had developed in his watercolours was to some extent carried over to his oil paintings, where the broad, free handling of the brush illustrates his admiration for Edouard Manet. During the 1890s his work displayed an increasingly strong feeling for the body’s plasticity, reminiscent of Auguste Renoir. However Zorn, like Sargent and his good friend Max Liebermann (whose portrait Zorn painted in 1891; Zorn Museum, Mora), belonged to the moderate Modernist phalanx who adopted features not only from Impressionism and Japonisme but also from the fashionable art of the Salon.

The model’s surroundings were important; Zorn believed that a portrait should be painted in an environment that was natural for the model. An artificial studio environment was not to his taste. The international esteem Zorn received was not based solely on his paintings but on his exquisite etchings as well. He had worked with this technique since 1882 and produced 289 etchings, a number of which are very well known, among them the portrait of Ernest Renan (1892), Auguste Rodin (1906) and the current example of August Strindberg.

Paul Feiler became associated with the post-war Modernists in St Ives, Cornwall. Feiler was born in Frankfurt-am-Main in 1918 to a cultured family who nurtured his early interest in art. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Feiler was sent to school first in Zwolle, The Netherlands, then Canford School in Dorset. By 1936 his parents had joined him in London, his father starting up a dentist practice in Harley Street andFeilerenrolling at the Slade School of Fine Art. Fellow students included Patrick Heron, Bryan Wynter and Kenneth Armitage. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Feiler was interned as an enemy alien in Canada. \n\nWhen he returned to the UK in 1941 he became a teacher at Eastbourne College then at the West of England College of Art in Bristol where, in 1960, he became Head of Painting. His work was first noticed in 1949 as part of the Arts Council’sYoung Contemporaries exhibition in Bristol, and in the following year in the Slade Contemporaries show. 1949 was also the year he first visited Cornwall where it didn’t take long for Heron to convince him to become involved with its thriving art scene. Soon Feiler was teaching at the St Ives summer school and, in 1953, he bought and converted a disused chapel in Kerris which became his main home (although he continued to teach in Bristol). \n\nHis first solo show was at the Redfern Gallery, London, in 1953;it was a sell-out. He continued to show at the gallery during the 1950s; in 1954 the Obelisk Gallery in Washington D.C. held the first of several solo exhibitions in America. During the 1950s and 1960s there were many connections between British and American abstract artists: Mark Rothko visited Cornwall in 1958, as is evident in a photograph taken by Feiler featuring Rothko and his wife Mell, together with Heron and Terry Frost, having tea with the Feilersat Kerris. As in Winter Landscape (1950), Feiler’s early gestural landscape oil paintings used thick, earthy colours applied in Expressionistic slabs. As the 1950s progressed, however, his style became more abstract, leaving elements of the landscape dangling in expanses of white, creamy space. It’s often considered that he was ahead of his time as, sadly, this coincided with critical neglect.\n\nExhilarated by coexisting explorations of space in the 1960s, however, Feiler’s accompanying series of more austere geometric abstractions – in which perpendicular and rectangular matrices framed either circular, square or striped inner spaces – formed a turning point. The Redferm Gallery re-engaged with him in 1993, hosting seven shows between 1993 and 2010. The Tate, St Ives, mounted two solo exhibitions (1995 and 2005) and he continued to work in his Cornish studio (which he’d taken over from Wynter in 1975) until his death in 2013.  Feiler’s work is held in public collections worldwide including the Tate, London, the Victoria &Albert Museum, London,the BibliothèqueNationale, Paris, the National Gallery of New Zealand, Wellington and the Gallery of Modern Art, Washington D.C.','Dissonanz',1547,'1547','Signed in white crayon and numbered 22/130, published by ABCD Editions.

His work was first noticed in 1949 as part of the Arts Council’sYoung Contemporaries exhibition in Bristol, and in the following year in the Slade Contemporaries show. 1949 was also the year he first visited Cornwall where it didn’t take long for Heron to convince him to become involved with its thriving art scene. Soon Feiler was teaching at the St Ives summer school and, in 1953, he bought and converted a disused chapel in Kerris which became his main home (although he continued to teach in Bristol). \n\nHis first solo show was at the Redfern Gallery, London, in 1953;it was a sell-out. He continued to show at the gallery during the 1950s; in 1954 the Obelisk Gallery in Washington D.C. held the first of several solo exhibitions in America. During the 1950s and 1960s there were many connections between British and American abstract artists: Mark Rothko visited Cornwall in 1958, as is evident in a photograph taken by Feiler featuring Rothko and his wife Mell, together with Heron and Terry Frost, having tea with the Feilersat Kerris. As in Winter Landscape (1950), Feiler’s early gestural landscape oil paintings used thick, earthy colours applied in Expressionistic slabs. As the 1950s progressed, however, his style became more abstract, leaving elements of the landscape dangling in expanses of white, creamy space. It’s often considered that he was ahead of his time as, sadly, this coincided with critical neglect.\n\nExhilarated by coexisting explorations of space in the 1960s, however, Feiler’s accompanying series of more austere geometric abstractions – in which perpendicular and rectangular matrices framed either circular, square or striped inner spaces – formed a turning point. The Redferm Gallery re-engaged with him in 1993, hosting seven shows between 1993 and 2010. The Tate, St Ives, mounted two solo exhibitions (1995 and 2005) and he continued to work in his Cornish studio (which he’d taken over from Wynter in 1975) until his death in 2013.  Feiler’s work is held in public collections worldwide including the Tate, London, the Victoria &Albert Museum, London,the BibliothèqueNationale, Paris, the National Gallery of New Zealand, Wellington and the Gallery of Modern Art, Washington D.C.','The First Empire',1557,'1557','Signed lower right','21st Century',2500,'Beech','Painted in San Felice Circeo, Italy','60071','Edition 26/75',-1,2500,-1,75,65,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave the US','','Mat staining, pale stains in margins, minor defects alongside edges of sheet.',NULL,168,1,21,1,1),(298,'From the late 1950s, Pierre Soulages’sbrushstrokes became looser and more rhythmical, until, by the mid-1960s, broadly brushed shapes extended right across the canvas in a gesture that appears to extend beyond the support.

By 1799 he was studying at the Royal Academy Schools training, as was the custom, as a history rather than landscape painter.

The Heinemann Gallery, founded in Munich in 1872, was an early supporter of Constable in Germany. The original, thin card support was laid onto a hardwood panel in the late 19th century. The panel was removed by Sarah Cove (Constable Research Project) in 2012 revealing the handwritten inscription ‘Walton Church/Epsom’ and dated by her to 1806.','Inspiration',1568,'1568','Signed lower left','21st Century',20700,'Oil on canvas','Painted in Toulouse, France','60082','Edition 117/150',-1,20700,-1,70,80,'This artwork requires an export licence to leave France','','',NULL,143,1,32,1,1),(309,'Portuguese-born French painter. Having arrived in Paris from Lisbon in 1928, a talented Marie-Hélène Vieira da Silva studieda diverse range of art: initially it was sculpture with Emile-Antoine Bourdelle and then with Charles Despiau; the following year she began engraving in Stanley William Hayter’s Atelier 17, before designing carpets for Dolly Chareau’s Art Deco interiors. The work of Joaquín Torres García (1874-1949), Uruguayan artist and theorist who was also living in Paris at this time, became an influence. He formed part of a future group Cercle et Carré (Circle and Square), promoter of the first exhibition of Constructivist and abstract art in Paris in 1930. This was the year Vieira da Silva married Hungarian artist Árpád Szènes. \n\nBy 1933 Vieira da Silva had exhibited in the highly respected Galerie Jeanne Bucher and in 1937 she had a second show there where her distinctive style using the diamonds and squares of Portuguese azulejos (tin-glazed ceramic tilework) combined with allusions to chessboards and card gamesbegan to come to the fore (e.g.Chess Game, 1943; Paris, Pompidou). \n\nVieiradaSilva’s subject matter became more strongly political prior to and during World War II as is evident in works such as Flags (1939; Düsseldorf, Kstsamml. Nordrhein-Westfalen), Disaster (War) (1941-2) and Liberation of Paris (1945). She and Szènes fled first to Portugal, then to Rio de Janeiro, where the couple mixed with the Brazilian intelligentsia. On their return to Paris, VieiradaSilva continued toexhibit at the Galerie Jeanne Bucher, displaying her grey palette yet citing the more colourful landscape Impressionists Jean Bazaine and Alfred Manessier, as well as the structural designs of Gustave Eiffel, as influences. \n\nThis Untitledpiece (circa 1965-70) was painted at a time when Vieira da Silva was at the height of her power: in 1966 she was the first woman to receive the French government’s Grand Prix National des Arts; its creation alsoco-incided with her retrospective at the Musée National d’Art Moderne in Paris (1969-70), which then toured to Rotterdam, Oslo, Basle and Lisbon. She moved in popular cultural circles: she painted a stage curtain for Arthur Adamov’s La Parodie,collaboratedregularly with poet René Char, as well as painting shield-like backdrops for sculptor Germaine Richier’s bronze figures.\n\nThe Árpád Szènes-Vieira da Silva Foundation in Lisbon, inaugurated in 1994, houses a museum that features both artists’ works.','Autotelic',1569,'1569','Signed ‘GAN’ and dated ‘28.

His Painting, dated 5 February 1964 and held at the Muséed’ArtContemporain Montreal, measures 2.35 x 3 metres. Some of these pictures were made using trowels or knives to scrape off parts of the upper layer of paint to reveal the red, yellow or blue underneath.Soulages never named his works, preferring to identify them with their date only.\n\nAlthough the bold, gestural character of Soulages’s work has often been compared to the Abstract Expressionism of such artists as Franz Kline, the resemblance is only superficial. Instead of relying on improvisation, he built up his forms very deliberately to achieve a formal, balanced beauty. His work took a decisive new turn in 1979, when he began to make very large paintings, often combining several panels that were entirely covered with a thick coat of black oil paint. For their effect, they relied on contrasts of texture, rhythm and direction of brushwork, produced by alternating bands of corrugated or smooth surfaces.\n\nSoulages’s output also incorporates aquatints, lithographs and, since 1975, bronzes connected to the irregular shapes of the plates used when creating the aquatints. He is well represented in museums throughout the world, notably in Germany, USA, Canada, Brazil, Japan, Scandinavia, London, Vienna, Jersualem, Rotterdam and Zürich, as well as several in France. In 2005 Soulages and his wife Colette donated 500 works to his native town of Rodez. A museum opening in 2014 is being built to house these works.','Paint on canvas',1570,'1570','Signed ‘GAN’ and dated ‘28.
